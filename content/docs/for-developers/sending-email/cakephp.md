CakePHP comes with an email library that already supports SMTP. [For more information check out the CakePHP documentation page](http://book.cakephp.org/2.0/en/core-utility-libraries/email.html#configuration). This example shows how to send an email with both HTML and text bodies.

In **app/views/layouts/** you need to define the layout of your text and HTML emails: 

```
email/
html/
default.ctp
text/
default.ctp
```
In **app/views/layouts/email/text/default.ctp** add:

``` php
<!--?php echo $content_for_layout; ?-->
```

 and in **app/views/layouts/email/html/default.ctp** add: 

``` php
<!--?php echo $content_for_layout; ?-->
```

 Then create the template for your emails. In this example we created templates for a registration email with the following structure: 

```
app/
views/
elements/
email/
text/
registration.ctp
html/
registration.ctp
```
In **app/views/elements/email/text/registration.ctp** add:

``` php
Dear <!--?php echo $name ?-->,
Thank you for registering. Please go to http://domain.com to finish your registration.
```

 and in **app/views/layouts/email/html/default.ctp** add: 

``` php
Dear <!--?php echo $name ?-->,
Thank you for registering. Please go to <a href="http://domain.com">here</a> to finish your registration.
```

 In your controller enable the email component:  
  
 

``` php
<!--?php var $components = array('Email'); ?--> 

```

 Then anywhere in your controller you can do something like the following to send an email: 

``` php
<?php
$this->Email->smtpOptions = array(
  'port'=>'587',
  'timeout'=>'30',
  'host' => 'smtp.sendgrid.net',
  'username'=>'sendgrid_username',
  'password'=>'sendgrid_password',
  'client' => 'yourdomain.com'
);

$this->Email->delivery = 'smtp';
$this->Email->from = 'Your Name ';
$this->Email->to = 'Recipient Name ';
$this->set('name', 'Recipient Name');
$this->Email->subject = 'This is a subject';
$this->Email->template = 'registration';
$this->Email->sendAs = 'both';
$this->Email->send();
?>
```
