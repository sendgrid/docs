<call-out>

We recommend using SendGrid Python, our client library, [available on GitHub](https://github.com/sendgrid/sendgrid-python), with full documentation.

</call-out>

<call-out>

The library does not officially support the V2 API, but you can use V2 with an older version of the library. For more information, see [Continue Using V2 in Python](https://github.com/sendgrid/sendgrid-python/blob/master/TROUBLESHOOTING.md#v2).

</call-out>

##  Using SendGrid's Python Library
```python
# using SendGrid's Python Library
# https://github.com/sendgrid/sendgrid-python
import sendgrid

client = sendgrid.SendGridClient("SENDGRID_APIKEY")
message = sendgrid.Mail()

message.add_to("test@sendgrid.com")
message.set_from("you@youremail.com")
message.set_subject("Sending with SendGrid is Fun")
message.set_html("and easy to do anywhere, even with Python")

client.send(message)
```
