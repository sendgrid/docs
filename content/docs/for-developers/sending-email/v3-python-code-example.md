<call-out>

We recommend using SendGrid Python, our client library, [available on GitHub](https://github.com/sendgrid/sendgrid-python), with full documentation.

Do you have an [API Key](https://app.sendgrid.com/settings/api_keys) yet? If not, go get one. You're going to need it to integrate!

from_email = Email("test@example.com")
to_email = Email("test@example.com")
subject = "Sending with SendGrid is Fun"
content = Content("text/plain", "and easy to do anywhere, even with Python")
mail = Mail(from_email, subject, to_email, content)
response = sg.client.mail.send.post(request_body=mail.get())
