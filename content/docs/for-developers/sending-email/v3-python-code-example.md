We recommend using SendGrid Python, our client library, [available on GitHub](https://github.com/sendgrid/sendgrid-python), with full documentation.

Do you have an [API Key](https://app.sendgrid.com/settings/api_keys) yet? If not, go get one. You're going to need it to integrate!

    to_emails='to@example.com',
    subject='Sending with Twilio SendGrid is Fun',
    html_content='<strong>and easy to do anywhere, even with Python</strong>')
try:

    response = sg.send(message)
    print(response.status_code)
    print(response.body)
