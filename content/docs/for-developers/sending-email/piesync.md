Follow these steps to set up a sync:

1. [Create a PieSync account](#-Create-a-PieSync-account)
2. [Select your apps](#Select-your-apps)
3. [Authorize your apps](#Authorize-your-apps)
4. [Set up your sync configuration](#Set-up-your-sync-configuration)


## Create a PieSync account

Sign up for a PieSync account [here](https://app.piesync.com/).


## Select your apps

Select SendGrid and the app you would like to sync with from within the PieSync application.


## Authorize your apps

To authorize, follow the steps as described and make sure you have your [API Key]({{root_url}}/ui/account-and-settings/api-keys/) before getting started.

If you have already authorized SendGrid account(s) in the past or have another PieSync integration, you can skip the first part of the authorization and choose from your **Connected Accounts**.

## Set up your sync configuration

From within the connection setup screen, you'll be able to manage the following:

### Filters and actions

```
[IF] Supported Conditions/Filters
   ALREADY EXISTING IN APP YOU SYNC WITH
   FIELD VALUES (INCLUDING CUSTOM FIELDS)
```

```
[THEN] Supported Actions
   UPDATING FIELD VALUES (INCLUDING CUSTOM FIELDS)
```

### Default Mapping

Depending on the other app you're syncing with, you'll see a number of standard SendGrid fields being mapped by default. For instance, in a connection with Google Contacts, the default field mapping looks like this:

### Customizable Field Mapping

You can custom map your SendGrid Custom Fields and any additional standard fields that aren't included in the default mapping yet. Remember, a mapping between 2 fields can only exist if the types of fields are compatible, and the particular compatibility will determine the direction of the mapping. See our documentation [Customizable Field Mapping](https://help.piesync.com/features/new-customizable-field-mapping) for more information.
