These instructions will walk you through how to add an SMTP server to an existing Outlook setup, but you can also add these settings at the account creation stage.

Click **Tools** and then select **Account Settings**.

The 'Account Settings' window appears. Select the account you receive email through and click **Change**.

The following 'Change E-mail Account' window appears. This setting (in the red rectangle below) needs to be set for our SMTP address.

After you are finished, click  **More Settings**. The following 'Internet E-mail Settings' window appears. Click **Outgoing Server** and input the settings shown (username and password are your SendGrid credentials).

Your SendGrid username may not necessarily be an email address. If your SendGrid username is example_user, enter example_user in the User Name field, not example_user@sendgrid.com.

Click **OK**. You should return to the 'Change E-mail Account' window. Click **Test Account Settings** to verify you are able to receive and send mail successfully.

Unfortunately, there is not an easy way to add SMTP API headers to a message in Outlook 2007.
