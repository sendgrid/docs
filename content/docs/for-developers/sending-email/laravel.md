Laravel provides a clean API over the popular SwiftMailer library with drivers for SMTP, PHP's `mail`, `sendmail` and more. For this example, we'll be sending an email with SendGrid using the SMTP Driver. For more information, check out the docs for [Laravel's Mail interface](http://laravel.com/docs/mail).

Laravel 5.5 LTS uses Mailable classes. Mailables in Laravel abstracts building emails with a mailable class. Mailables are responsible for collating data and passing them to views.


## Before you begin

In `.env` you need to find and configure these variables: 

```
MAIL_DRIVER=smtp
MAIL_HOST=smtp.sendgrid.net
MAIL_PORT=587
MAIL_USERNAME=sendgrid_username
MAIL_PASSWORD=sendgrid_password
MAIL_ENCRYPTION=tls
MAIL_FROM_NAME="John Smith"
MAIL_FROM_ADDRESS=from@example.com
```

<call-out>
The `MAIL_FROM_NAME` field requires double quotes because there is a space in the string.
</call-out>

<call-out>
You can send `100 messages per SMTP connection` at a time, and open up to `10 concurrent connections` from a single server at a time.
</call-out>


## Creating a Mailable

Next you need to create a Mailable class, Laravel's CLI tool called Artisan makes that a simple feat.
Open CLI, go to the project directory and type:

`php artisan make:mail TestEmail`

This command will create a new file under `app/Mail/TestEmail.php` and it should look something like this:

``` php
<?php

namespace App\Mail;

use Illuminate\Bus\Queueable;
use Illuminate\Mail\Mailable;
use Illuminate\Queue\SerializesModels;
use Illuminate\Contracts\Queue\ShouldQueue;

class TestEmail extends Mailable
{
    use Queueable, SerializesModels;

    public $data;

    public function __construct($data)
    {
        $this->data = $data;
    }

    public function build()
    {
        $address = 'janeexampexample@example.com';
        $subject = 'This is a demo!';
        $name = 'Jane Doe';
        
        return $this->view('emails.test')
                    ->from($address, $name)
                    ->cc($address, $name)
                    ->bcc($address, $name)
                    ->replyTo($address, $name)
                    ->subject($subject)
                    ->with([ 'message' => $this->data['message'] ]);
    }
}
```
In Laravel `Views` are used as 'templates' when sending an email. Let's create a file under `app/resources/views/emails/test.blade.php` and insert this code:

``` html
<!DOCTYPE html>
    <html lang="en-US">
    	<head>
    		<meta charset="utf-8">
    	</head>
    	<body>
    		<h2>Test Email</h2>
    		<p>{{ $message }}</p>
    	</body>
    </html>
```
## Sending an email

Now that we have our Mailable Class created, all we need to do is run this code:

``` php
<?php
    use App\Mail\TestEmail;

    $data = ['message' => 'This is a test!'];

    Mail::to('john@example.com')->send(new TestEmail($data));
```

## Adding a category or custom field

Categories in SendGrid allow you to split your statistics into sections. For example, if you have a Whitelabeled service, you can split your statistics by the user login.

Another useful tool is event notifications. If you want to complete the feedback loop for your product you can pass identifiers as a header which relate to a record in your database which you can then parse the notifications against that record to track deliveries/opens/clicks/bounces.

The `withSwiftMessage` method of the `Mailable` base class allows you to register the callback that is invoked with the raw SwiftMailer message instance before sending the message. This knowledge allows you to customize the message before delivery. To customize your message, use something similar to this:

``` php
<?php

namespace App\Mail;

use Illuminate\Bus\Queueable;
use Illuminate\Mail\Mailable;
use Illuminate\Queue\SerializesModels;
use Illuminate\Contracts\Queue\ShouldQueue;

class TestEmail extends Mailable
{
    use Queueable, SerializesModels;

    public $data;

    public function __construct($data)
    {
        $this->data = $data;
    }

    public function build()
    {
        $address = 'janeexampexample@example.com';
        $subject = 'This is a demo!';
        $name = 'Jane Doe';

        $headerData = [
            'category' => 'category',
            'unique_args' => [
                'variable_1' => 'abc'
            ]
        ];

        $header = $this->asString($headerData);
        
        $this->withSwiftMessage(function ($message) use ($header) {
            $message->getHeaders()
                    ->addTextHeader('X-SMTPAPI', $header);
        });
        
        return $this->view('emails.test')
                    ->from($address, $name)
                    ->cc($address, $name)
                    ->bcc($address, $name)
                    ->replyTo($address, $name)
                    ->subject($subject)
                    ->with([ 'data' => $this->data ]);
    }

    private function asJSON($data)
    {
        $json = json_encode($data);
        $json = preg_replace('/(["\]}])([,:])(["\[{])/', '$1$2 $3', $json);

        return $json;
    }


    private function asString($data)
    {
        $json = $this->asJSON($data);
        
        return wordwrap($json, 76, "\n   ");
    }
}
```
