## 	Parse Webhook

<call-out>

We recommend using our official Python SDK, our client library with full documentation, when integrating with <a href="https://github.com/sendgrid/sendgrid-python/tree/master/sendgrid/helpers/inbound">SendGrid's Inbound Parse Webhook</a>.

</call-out>

In this example, we want to parse all emails at *address*@email.sendgrid.biz and post the parsed email to http://sendgrid.biz/parse. In this example we will be using Python the Flask framework.

Given this scenario, the following are the parameters you would set at the [Parse API settings page](https://sendgrid.com/developer/reply):

```
Hostname: email.sendgrid.biz
```

```
URL: http://sendgrid.biz/parse
```

  To test this scenario, we sent an email to example@example.com and created the following code:

```python
from flask import Flask, request
import simplejson
app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/parse', methods=['POST'])
def sendgrid_parser():
  # Consume the entire email
  envelope = simplejson.loads(request.form.get('envelope'))

  # Get some header information
  to_address = envelope['to'][0]
  from_address = envelope['from']

  # Now, onto the body
  text = request.form.get('text')
  html = request.form.get('html')
  subject = request.form.get('subject')

  # Process the attachements, if any
  num_attachments = int(request.form.get('attachments', 0))
  attachments = []
  if num_attachments > 0:
    for num in range(1, (num_attachments + 1)):
      attachment = request.files.get(('attachment%d' % num))
      attachments.append(attachment.read())
      # attachment will have all the parameters expected in a Flask file upload

  return "OK"

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(debug=True)

```
