Whether you’re a startup or a large enterprise, SendGrid has several plans tailored to meet your email needs. 

## Upgrade your SendGrid plan

Before you can upgrade account, you need to complete some verification steps for security purposes.

<call-out type="warning">

If you signed up for a Twilio SendGrid account prior to 9/17/2020, skip to the [choose a plan](#choose-a-plan) section of this page.

</call-out>

*To unlock your Twilio SendGrid account:*

1. Confirm your email address. If you need to resend the verification email, click **Resend account verification**. If you entered your email address incorrectly in the initial signup form, you can correct the email address and resend the verification email to the correct address.
1. Set up [Domain Authentication]({{root_url}}/ui/account-and-settings/how-to-set-up-domain-authentication/).
Authenticating your domain shows email providers that Twilio SendGrid has your permission to send emails on your behalf.

<call-out>

If you don't have access to your domain's DNS records, you can use the **Send To A Coworker** feature. This feature allows you to enter a colleague's email address so Twilio SendGrid can send them all the information they need to complete domain authentication on your behalf.

3. Set up [Two-Factor Authentication]({{root_url}}/ui/account-and-settings/two-factor-authentication/)

4. Add a [payment method]({{root_url}}/ui/account-and-settings/billing/#payment-methods). Your card will not be charged at this time.
