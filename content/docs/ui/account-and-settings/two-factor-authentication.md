Two-factor authentication, commonly referred to as multi-factor authentication, allows you to make your SendGrid account more secure by requiring authentication beyond a simple username and password when logging in.

SendGrid’s Two-Factor Authentication can be configured to accept a code sent to your mobile phone either via the [Authy App](https://www.authy.com/app/mobile/), or an SMS message.

## 	Setting Up Two-Factor Authentication
 	
You may choose from 2 different verification methods when using two-factor authentication:

1. Generate a verification code with the [Authy App](https://www.authy.com/app/mobile/).
   The Authy App allows you to authenticate over WiFi if you do not have cellular service. However, you may still resort to an SMS message as a backup if you decide to use Authy.
1. Enter a code sent to your mobile phone that is generated by SendGrid.

When authenticating via SMS message, you must have cellular service, or you will not be able to log into your account.

You can create multiple configurations of Two-Factor Authentication, allowing you to use more than one mobile device to authenticate when logging into your account.

*To set up Two-Factor Authentication:*

1. Navigate to **Settings**, and click **Two-Factor Authentication**.
 <br>From this page, you see an overview of your Two-Factor Authentication settings, along with any settings that you have created for credentialed users.
1. Click **Add Two-Factor Authentication**.
1. Select either the Authy App or text messages (SMS) as your means of authentication.
1. Enter your **country code** and **phone number**.

Subusers and Teammates need to create their own Two-Factor Authentication settings in their account using the same steps.

## 	Using Two-Factor Authentication
 	
After you create a setting for Two-Factor Authentication, log in as you normally would. If you opt to receive a text message with your authentication token, look for the text message and enter the code that you receive. If you have selected the Authy App, go to your app, and enter the generated code.

Once set up, you will always be required to use Two-Factor Authentication to perform security-restricted actions in your SendGrid account, such as logging in or changing your Two-Factor Authentication settings. When prompted, enter the 7-digit token sent to your device, or generated by the Authy App.

## 	Disabling Two-Factor Authentication
 	
*To disable or delete a Two-Factor Authentication setting:*

1. Navigate to **Settings**, and click **Two-Factor Authentication**.
1. Find the setting you would like to delete.
1. Click the **action menu**, and then select **Delete**.
1. Enter the 7 digit code you receive via text or Authy app into the field and then click **Delete**.
