A bounce occurs when a sent message is rejected by the receiving mail server. The most common causes for bounced email messages include a misspelled or nonexistent email address. A repeat bounce is when an address has bounced, then bounced a second time and logged to the bounce suppression list, but you ask us to send to this recipient again. Our system will suppress the message, because it ‘knows’ that recipient address is bad.

## 	Bounce Notifications

If you would like to receive a notification for each bounce message, you can turn on Bounce Forwarding in your Mail Settings.

## 	Searching Bounces by Date

In the top right corner, you will see a calendar icon. Click this and choose the unsubscribe dates you would like to search between. Your recipient list will refresh, showing the recipients who unsubscribed between these dates.

## 	Download Bounces as CSV

You can download your Bounce list as a CSV by clicking the gear icon at the top of the page and selecting **Download CSV**. The file will download in your browser right away.

## 	Removing Recipients From The List

When you select the checkboxes next to the recipient names or select all, using the checkbox next to the search box, you will see a new button at the top of the page. From this list, you can choose to remove the selected recipients from the list. You can also use the Bounce Purge.
