  Description: How to use SendGrid's new email testing feature to see how your email shows up in different inboxes and across different devices and operating systems.
---
<call-out>

Email Testing is available as part of the new Marketing Campaigns. To access this feature, please switch over to the [new Marketing Campaigns experience](https://sendgrid.com/pricing/).

</call-out>

Email testing offers robust, pre-send testing of your emails, including in-app spam testing, inbox rendering previews, and link validation without leaving your Marketing Campaigns workflow. It allows you to preview how an email is likely to perform across a wide range of inbox providers, devices, and spam filters, before sending.

- **Inbox Rendering Test:** Displays how an email message is rendered and appears across a select group of inbox providers and devices.
- **Spam Test:** Shows how an email performs against the worldâ€™s most powerful consumer (B2C) and enterprise (B2B) spam filters.
- **Link Validation Test:** Tests all links within a message to ensure they are valid. The test checks for redirects, domain reputation, and critical metadata, like title text. Your inbox rendering tests will automatically include this link validation test. Link validation tests **do not** deduct from your Email Testing credits.

## Email Testing credits and pricing

The number of Email Testing credits available to you depends on your Marketing Campaigns plan. 10 Email Testing credits per month are available for customers on Basic plans, with 60 Email Testing credits per month available to customers on Advanced plans. Email Testing credits can be used for both Inbox Rendering Tests and Spam Tests and all Email Testing credits (whether part of your plan or purchased as part of an add-on package) expire at the end of each month. 

## Purchasing additional credits

If you find yourself in need of more credits than your Marketing Campaigns plan offers, we offer additional Email Testing credit packages as add-ons to your monthly plan.

  Note: Packages for additional Email Testing credits are billed on a monthly, recurring basis and will continue to renew each month unless removed from your account.

4. When Email Testing opens a new test, choose which kind of tests you'd like to run by selecting the checkboxes next to **Spam Test**, **Inbox Rendering Test**, or by selecting both.

<call-out>

Every inbox rendering test that you run automatically includes a link validation test, checking that all URLs within your message are valid. Link validation tests **do not** deduct from your Email Testing credits.
