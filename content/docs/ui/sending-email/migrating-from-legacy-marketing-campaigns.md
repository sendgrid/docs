## What does the new Marketing Campaigns offer? 

The new Marketing Campaigns builds on the existing, well-loved workflows for building, targeting, sending, and measuring email marketing campaigns with three new features: Automation, Email Testing, and Signup Forms. 

### Automation

Create a recurring email or series of emails that send automatically whenever a contact joins a list. Choose when each email sends, and whether a contact should exit the automation if they no longer meet the entry criteria. [Learn More] ({{root_url}}/ui/sending-email/getting-started-with-automation/). 

### Email Testing 

Have confidence your emails are flawless with integrated email testing. See how emails render across the inboxes, browsers, and device types that matter to your business, ensure links within your email are valid, and know how your email will perform against the most powerful spam filters. [Learn More] ({{root_url}}/ui/sending-email/email-testing/). 

### Signup Forms 

Capture new signups and add them directly to your contacts in the new Marketing Campaigns. These forms can be embedded directly on your website or shared via a Twilio SendGrid-hosted URL. [Learn More]({{root_url}}/ui/managing-contacts/create-and-manage-contacts/#create-a-signup-form). 

### Familiar features and functionality from legacy 

These new features build on the functionality you’re used to in legacy Marketing Campaigns. This means after a few migration steps, you’ll be up and running quickly thanks to familiar workflows you already know.  

All features from legacy Marketing Campaigns will be carried over to new Marketing Campaigns, though there are a few that will not be available immediately. You can track those items on our [coming soon to Marketing Campaigns page]({{root_url}}/ui/sending-email/coming-soon-to-new-marketing-campaigns/). 

<call-out>

What you’re used to as “Campaigns” in legacy Marketing Campaigns is now called “Single Sends” in new Marketing Campaigns.

</call-out>

## Why aren’t you migrating my account automatically? 

The new Marketing Campaigns has been re-built from the ground up on a new platform, which brings benefits like increased speed, scale, and stability. However, because it’s an entirely new product, it is not connected to the legacy Marketing Campaigns, and we’re not yet able to automatically move your assets and data. 

To support you in migrating your legacy Marketing Campaigns account to the new Marketing Campaigns, we’re providing you with a billing grace period. During this grace period, you won’t be charged for legacy Marketing Campaigns contact storage. The grace period covers the month you upgrade to a Basic or Advanced package and 1 month after you upgrade.

## Choosing a new Marketing Campaigns plan

### How is the pricing different for the new plans?

**Legacy Marketing Campaigns Pricing**

With the legacy offering, you selected a base Email API plan to cover all email sends whether via Email API or Marketing Campaigns. Next, you paid $10 per 10,000 contacts you uploaded into Marketing Campaigns. 

Any emails you sent using Marketing Campaigns were deducted from your base Email API plan allotment. If you sent over your plan allotment you were charged overages per additional email. 

**New Marketing Campaigns Pricing**

With the new Marketing Campaigns, you choose a Marketing Campaigns package, either [Basic or Advanced](#what-are-the-new-package-options). Basic starts at $15/mo and Advanced starts at $60/mo.

The package includes an allotment of **both** contacts you can store and emails you can send. If you send over your allotment of emails or store more contacts you will be charged an additional fee per email or contact.

Emails that you send via new Marketing Campaigns are deducted from your Marketing Campaigns package, **not** from your Email API plan. 


### What are the new package options?

There are three new packages for Marketing Campaigns, Free, Basic, and Advanced. For complete pricing and feature detail, please visit our [pricing page](https://sendgrid.com/pricing/). To upgrade your current page, go to **Settings** and then select **Your Products**.

### What should I consider in choosing a new package? 

To decide the best package for your needs, Basic or Advanced, consider the features you’d like included in your Marketing Campaigns package, your historical usage with legacy Marketing Campaigns, and what access to add-ons you need. 

*Features you’d like to access*

Choose **Advanced** if you’d like any of the following features. A complete summary of the feature set for each Marketing Campaigns package can be found on [our pricing page](https://sendgrid.com/pricing/).

<call-out>

</call-out>

Choose **Basic** if following features meet your needs. A complete summary of the feature set for each Marketing Campaigns package can be found on [our pricing page](https://sendgrid.com/pricing/). 

* Single Sends for one-time campaigns
* Ticket, Chat, and Phone Support
* 10 Email Testing Credits per month with the option to purchase more
* 5 Signup Forms
* 1 Teammate
* Access to Expert Services

*Historical usage*

Review how many contacts you store in legacy Marketing Campaigns as a starting point, then consider if or how you may grow your audience. Do the same for in considering your legacy Marketing Campaigns sending volume by adding up the number of delivered emails across your campaigns. Remember, the new Marketing Campaigns packages also include email sends, so if you only send via Marketing Campaigns, you’ll potentially no longer need to subscribe to an Email API plan. 

*Add-ons you need*

There are some add-ons that are only available with certain package types. 
**Additional dedicated IPs** can only be purchased if you have either a Pro or Premier Email API plan or an Advanced Marketing Campaigns plan.
**Email Activity Feed** is only available if you’re on a paid Email API plan.
 
### Do I need to change my Email API plan?

You don’t need to change your Email API plan. However, depending on your feature needs and usage, it may make sense to review your plan and make an adjustment. To start, consider how many emails you typically send through Email API vs. Marketing Campaigns when making your decision. 

*Example*:

You currently have a **Pro 300K Email API plan** and store **45,000 contacts** in Marketing Campaigns. **Net cost is $249.95** ($199.95 + $50).

In an average month, you send 90,000 emails via Email API, and 150,000 emails through Marketing Campaigns. 

You want to use the new Advanced Marketing Campaigns features, including Automation. 

In this scenario, you might choose to change your Email API plan to **Pro 100K**  and choose the **Marketing Campaigns Advanced 50K plan. Net cost will be $329.95** ($79.95 + $250). You can send 100,000 emails via Email API and 250,000 emails using Marketing Campaigns.

## How do I upgrade my Marketing Campaigns plan? 

1. Navigate to **Settings**, click **Account Details**, and then **Your Products**.
1. Review your current plan details as well as your usage this month. It’s helpful to have a sense of how many emails you’re sending and how many contacts you store.

<call-out>

You can review prior usage by navigating to **Invoices** under **Plan & Billing**, and checking your invoices there. Take a look at [Reading your Invoice]({{root_url}}/ui/account-and-settings/reading-your-invoice/) to learn more about reading and understanding your invoices. 

</call-out>

3. Click **Upgrade Plan** to choose your new Marketing Campaigns plan. 
4. By default, your plan will be Free 2K. To select a new plan, start by deciding whether you want Basic or Advanced features.
5. Next, choose the right tier of contact storage and volume of emails that you’ll send using Marketing Campaigns in a given month. 

<call-out>

Need a higher tier of contact storage or email volume? Simply scroll to the bottom of the page to request custom pricing. Today, we support storing up to 1M contacts.

</call-out>

6. Click **Select** to review your plan choice. You’ll see your new Marketing Campaigns plan monthly price, as well as the prorated price you’ll pay for the current month.
7. Click **Confirm**.  

<call-out>

No change will be made to your legacy Marketing Campaigns account as a result of buying a new Marketing Campaigns package. You'll have **through** the next complete month to migrate your account to avoid being charged for both versions, as outlined below.

</call-out>


To support your migration effort, you’ll have a billing grace period through the next complete billing cycle to migrate your contacts from legacy Marketing Campaigns to new Marketing Campaigns. During this grace period, which **includes the month you upgrade and the month following your upgrade**, you will not be charged for contact storage in legacy Marketing Campaigns.

<call-out type="warning">

If you have more than 2,000 contacts in legacy Marketing Campaigns at the end of the billing grace period, you’ll be charged $10 per 10,000 legacy Marketing Campaigns contacts moving forward. 

</call-out>

## Migrate your contacts

You can choose to migrate all of your contacts to new Marketing Campaigns, or you can migrate specific lists and segments. You can do this via the UI by exporting from legacy and importing to new Marketing Campaigns or you can use the Contact Management APIs.

While you can download the contacts who are on a segment at the time you export and add them to All Contacts or a list, you cannot migrate the segment logic you’ve built. You’ll need to re-create [segments]({{root_url}}/ui/managing-contacts/segmenting-your-contacts/) you’d like to use in new Marketing Campaigns.

*Migrate contacts using the UI*:

1. Navigate to **Contacts** in legacy Marketing Campaigns.
1. Find the list or segment of contacts you wish to export. 
1. Hover over the action menu and select the **Export** icon.
1. Once the export is completed, a download link will be sent to the email(s) you either signed up with, or have set to receive [notifications]({{root_url}}/ui/account-and-settings/notifications/).
1. Navigate to **Contacts** in new Marketing Campaigns.

<call-out>

Before uploading your CSV, make sure it is formatted correctly by comparing it to this [template]({{root_url}}/assets/example.csv).

</call-out>

6. Click **Add Contacts** and then select **Upload CSV**.
7. Choose whether to add your contacts to All Contacts, to an existing list, or to a new list you create.
8. Upload your CSV file by dragging it into or clicking the CSV upload area. 
Make sure all of the column headers you wish to import are mapped to custom fields.

<call-out>

If there are any column headers you have not made custom fields for yet, you can click on **Select a Field**, and then scroll down the drop-down menu and click **Create New** [**Custom Field**]({{root_url}}/ui/sending-email/custom-fields/).

</call-out>

9. Once the CSV file has finished processing, a download link will be sent to the email(s) you either signed up with, or have set to receive [notifications]({{root_url}}/ui/account-and-settings/notifications/).

<call-out type="warning">

If you add contacts to any lists being used as the entry criteria for a live [automation]({{root_url}}/ui/sending-email/getting-started-with-automation/), all contacts you add to that list will be entered into the automation. 

If you add contacts to a list that you’d like to use as the entry criteria for an Automation in the future, note that the automation will only trigger to contacts who are added to the entry criteria list *after* you set the automation live.

</call-out>

## Migrate your content

You may have pre-existing images, templates, or campaigns that you’d like to re-use in the new Marketing Campaigns. You can transfer your assets into new Marketing Campaigns by following the steps below.

### Templates

1. Navigate to **Templates** in legacy Marketing Campaigns.
1. Select **Custom**.
1. Locate the template you wish to transfer into new Marketing Campaigns.
1. Click the action menu and then select **Export HTML**. The template HTML instantly downloads to the folder specified on your computer.

<call-out type="warning">

Images embedded in your templates or past campaigns will continue to populate from your legacy Marketing Campaigns image library. To ensure no images break in the future when legacy Marketing Campaigns is deprecated, consider updating links to pull images from your new Marketing Campaigns image library.

</call-out>

5. Navigate to **Templates** in new Marketing Campaigns and select **My Templates**.
6. Click **Create Template**, and then select either the **Design Editor** or the **Code Editor**.

<call-out> 

Switching from a template made in the Code Editor into a Design Editor can cause some unwanted changes. Sticking to the editor you started with can help keep this transfer smooth and prevent any formatting issues.

</call-out>

8. Paste the HTML you copied from the downloaded file into the code editor and then click **Save** if you are using the **Code Editor**. Click **Update** and then **Save** if you are using the **Design Editor** .

Make sure that you are using the new [substitution tags]({{root_url}}/ui/sending-email/editor/#using-substitution-tags). For example, instead of using ``[%first_name%]``, you will now use ``{{first_name}}``.

![]({{root_url}}/img/substitution-tag-comparison.png "substitution tag comparison")

<call-out> 

Make sure that your unsubscription tags and groups are also up to date. You can learn more about how to format these tags [here]({{root_url}}/ui/sending-email/create-and-manage-unsubscribe-groups/). 

</call-out>

### Campaign designs

You may have email designs from campaigns that you’d like to re-use in new Marketing Campaigns that aren’t saved as a standalone template. You can do so by exporting the email content from these campaigns and importing them as a template in new Marketing Campaigns.

1. Select **Blank Template**.
1. Select either the **Code Editor** or **Design Editor**. 
1. If you’re using the **Design Editor**, navigate to **Build**, select **Advanced** and then click **Import Drag & Drop HTML**. If you’re using the **Code Editor**, paste in the HTML.
1. Paste the HTML you copied from the downloaded file into the code editor and then click **Save** if you are using the **Code Editor** and **Update** and then **Save** if you are using the **Design Editor** .
