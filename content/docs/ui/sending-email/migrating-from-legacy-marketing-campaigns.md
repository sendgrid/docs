## What does Marketing Campaigns offer? 

The new Marketing Campaigns builds on the existing, well-loved workflows for building, targeting, sending, and measuring email marketing campaigns with three new features: Automation, Email Testing, and Signup Forms. 

### Automation

Create a recurring email or series of emails that send automatically whenever a contact joins a list. Choose when each email sends, and whether a contact should exit the automation if they no longer meet the entry criteria. [Learn More]({{root_url}}/ui/sending-email/getting-started-with-automation/). 

### Email Testing 

Have confidence your emails are flawless with integrated email testing. See how emails render across the inboxes, browsers, and device types that matter to your business, ensure links within your email are valid, and know how your email will perform against the most powerful spam filters. [Learn More]({{root_url}}/ui/sending-email/email-testing/). 

### Signup Forms 

Capture new signups and add them directly to your contacts in the new Marketing Campaigns. These forms can be embedded directly on your website or shared via a Twilio SendGrid-hosted URL. [Learn More]({{root_url}}/ui/managing-contacts/create-and-manage-contacts/#create-a-signup-form). 

### Familiar features and functionality from legacy 

These new features build on the functionality you’re used to in legacy Marketing Campaigns. This means after a few migration steps, you’ll be up and running quickly thanks to familiar workflows you already know.  

All features from legacy Marketing Campaigns will be carried over to Marketing Campaigns, though there are a few that will not be available immediately. You can track those items on our [coming soon to Marketing Campaigns page]({{root_url}}/ui/sending-email/coming-soon-to-new-marketing-campaigns/). 

<call-out>

What you’re used to as “Campaigns” in legacy Marketing Campaigns is now called “Single Sends” in Marketing Campaigns.

</call-out>

## Why aren’t you migrating my account automatically? 

Marketing Campaigns has been re-built from the ground up on a new platform, which brings benefits like increased speed, scale, and stability. However, because it’s an entirely new product, it is not connected to the legacy Marketing Campaigns, and we’re not yet able to automatically move your assets and data. 

To support you in migrating your legacy Marketing Campaigns account to Marketing Campaigns, we’re providing you with a billing grace period. During this grace period, you won’t be charged for legacy Marketing Campaigns contact storage. The grace period covers the month you upgrade to a Basic or Advanced package and 1 month after you upgrade.

## Choosing a new Marketing Campaigns plan

### How is the pricing different for the new plans?

**Legacy Marketing Campaigns Pricing**

With the legacy offering, you selected a base Email API plan to cover all email sends whether via Email API or Marketing Campaigns. Next, you paid $10 per 10,000 contacts you **stored** in Marketing Campaigns.

Any emails you sent using Marketing Campaigns were deducted from your base Email API plan allotment. If you sent over your plan allotment, you were charged overages per additional email.

**New Marketing Campaigns Pricing**

With the new Marketing Campaigns, you choose a Marketing Campaigns package, either Basic or Advanced. Basic starts at $15/mo and Advanced starts at $60/mo.

The package includes an allotment of both contacts you can upload and emails you can send. If you send over your allotment of emails or **upload** more contacts you will be charged an additional fee per email or contact.  **Deleting contacts does not reset the total count for contacts uploaded**.

Any emails you send via new Marketing Campaigns are deducted from your Marketing Campaigns package, not from your Email API plan.

### What are the new package options?

There are three new packages for Marketing Campaigns, Free, Basic, and Advanced. For complete pricing and feature detail, please visit our [pricing page](https://sendgrid.com/pricing/). To upgrade your current page, go to **Settings** and then select **Your Products**.

### What should I consider in choosing a new package? 

To decide the best package for your needs, Basic or Advanced, consider the features you’d like included in your Marketing Campaigns package, your historical usage with legacy Marketing Campaigns, and what access to add-ons you need. 

*Features you’d like to access*

Choose **Advanced** if you’d like any of the following features. A complete summary of the feature set for each Marketing Campaigns package can be found on [our pricing page](https://sendgrid.com/pricing/). 

* Automation
* Greater allotment of monthly Email Testing credits
* Greater allotment of Signup Forms

<call-out>

*These features are also available on the Pro and Premier Email API packages. If you have access via your Email API package, you can also use these features for your Marketing Campaigns sending.

</call-out>

Choose **Basic** if following features meet your needs. A complete summary of the feature set for each Marketing Campaigns package can be found on [our pricing page](https://sendgrid.com/pricing/). 

* Single Sends for one-time campaigns
* Ticket, Chat, and Phone Support
* 10 Email Testing Credits per month with the option to purchase more
* 5 Signup Forms
* 1 Teammate
* Access to Expert Services

*Historical usage*

Review how many contacts you store in legacy Marketing Campaigns as a starting point, then consider if or how you may grow your audience. Do the same for in considering your legacy Marketing Campaigns sending volume by adding up the number of delivered emails across your campaigns. Remember, the new Marketing Campaigns packages also include email sends, so if you only send via Marketing Campaigns, you’ll potentially no longer need to subscribe to an Email API plan. 

<call-out type="warning">

**Please note:** Downgrading from a paid Basic or Advanced Marketing Campaigns plan to a Free account will permanently delete all contacts associated with that account. You will need to reimport any contacts that you would like to use with your Free account.

</call-out>

*Add-ons you need*

There are some add-ons that are only available with certain package types. 
**Additional dedicated IPs** can only be purchased if you have either a Pro or Premier Email API plan or an Advanced Marketing Campaigns plan.
**Email Activity Feed** is only available if you’re on a paid Email API plan.
 
### Do I need to change my Email API plan?

You don’t need to change your Email API plan. However, depending on your feature needs and usage, it may make sense to review your plan and make an adjustment. To start, consider how many emails you typically send through Email API vs. Marketing Campaigns when making your decision. 

*Example*:

You currently have a **Pro 300K Email API plan** and store **45,000 contacts** in Marketing Campaigns. **Net cost is $369.00** ($249.00 + $120).

In an average month, you send 90,000 emails via Email API, and 150,000 emails through Marketing Campaigns. 

You want to use the new Advanced Marketing Campaigns features, including Automation. 

In this scenario, you might choose to change your Email API plan to **Pro 100K**  and choose the **Marketing Campaigns Advanced 50K plan. Net cost will be $339.95** ($89.95 + $250). You can send 100,000 emails via Email API and 250,000 emails using Marketing Campaigns.

## How do I upgrade my Marketing Campaigns plan?

1. Navigate to **Settings**, click **Account Details**, and then **Your Products**.
1. Review your current plan details as well as your usage this month. It’s helpful to have a sense of how many emails you’re sending and how many contacts you store.

<call-out>

You can review prior usage by navigating to **Invoices** under **Plan & Billing**, and checking your invoices there. Take a look at [Reading your Invoice]({{root_url}}/ui/account-and-settings/reading-your-invoice/) to learn more about reading and understanding your invoices. 

</call-out>

3. Click **Upgrade Plan** to choose your new Marketing Campaigns plan. 
4. By default, your plan will be Free 2K. To select a new plan, start by deciding whether you want Basic or Advanced features.
5. Next, choose the right tier of contact storage and volume of emails that you’ll send using Marketing Campaigns in a given month. 

<call-out>

Need a higher tier of contact storage or email volume? Simply scroll to the bottom of the page to request custom pricing. Today, we support storing up to 1M contacts.

</call-out>

6. Click **Select** to review your plan choice. You’ll see your new Marketing Campaigns plan monthly price, as well as the prorated price you’ll pay for the current month.
7. Click **Confirm**.  

<call-out>

No change will be made to your legacy Marketing Campaigns account as a result of buying a new Marketing Campaigns package. You'll have **through** the next complete month to migrate your account to avoid being charged for both versions, as outlined below.

</call-out>


To support your migration effort, you’ll have a billing grace period through the next complete billing cycle to migrate your contacts from legacy Marketing Campaigns to new Marketing Campaigns. During this grace period, which **includes the month you upgrade and the month following your upgrade**, you will not be charged for contact storage in legacy Marketing Campaigns.

<call-out type="warning">

If you have more than 2,000 contacts in legacy Marketing Campaigns at the end of the billing grace period, you’ll be charged $10 per 10,000 legacy Marketing Campaigns contacts moving forward. 

</call-out>

## Migrate your contacts

You can choose to migrate all of your contacts to new Marketing Campaigns, or you can migrate specific lists and segments. You can do this via the UI by exporting from legacy and importing to new Marketing Campaigns or you can use the Contact Management APIs.

While you can download the contacts who are on a segment at the time you export and add them to All Contacts or a list, you cannot migrate the segment logic you’ve built. You’ll need to re-create [segments]({{root_url}}/ui/managing-contacts/segmenting-your-contacts/) you’d like to use in new Marketing Campaigns.

*Migrate contacts using the UI*:

1. Navigate to **Contacts** in legacy Marketing Campaigns.
1. Find the list or segment of contacts you wish to export. 
1. Hover over the action menu and select the **Export** icon.
1. Once the export is completed, a download link will be sent to the email(s) you either signed up with, or have set to receive [notifications]({{root_url}}/ui/account-and-settings/notifications/).
1. Navigate to **Contacts** in new Marketing Campaigns.

<call-out>

Before uploading your CSV, make sure it is formatted correctly by comparing it to this [template]({{root_url}}/assets/example.csv).

</call-out>

6. Click **Add Contacts** and then select **Upload CSV**.
7. Choose whether to add your contacts to All Contacts, to an existing list, or to a new list you create.
8. Upload your CSV file by dragging it into or clicking the CSV upload area. 
Make sure all of the column headers you wish to import are mapped to custom fields.

<call-out>

If there are any column headers you have not made custom fields for yet, you can click on **Select a Field**, and then scroll down the drop-down menu and click **Create New** [**Custom Field**]({{root_url}}/ui/sending-email/custom-fields/).

</call-out>

9. Once the CSV file has finished processing, a download link will be sent to the email(s) you either signed up with, or have set to receive [notifications]({{root_url}}/ui/account-and-settings/notifications/).

<call-out type="warning">

If you add contacts to any lists being used as the entry criteria for a live [automation]({{root_url}}/ui/sending-email/getting-started-with-automation/), all contacts you add to that list will be entered into the automation. 

If you add contacts to a list that you’d like to use as the entry criteria for an Automation in the future, note that the automation will only trigger to contacts who are added to the entry criteria list *after* you set the automation live.

</call-out>

10. Once you have migrated your contacts to the new Marketing Campaigns, please [delete your contacts from the legacy Marketing Camapigns]({{root_url}}/ui/managing-contacts/create-and-manage-contacts/#delete-all-contacts) to ensure you are no longer charged for contact storage in legacy Marketing Campaigns. 

## Migrate your content

You may have pre-existing images, templates, or campaigns that you’d like to re-use in Marketing Campaigns. You can transfer your assets into new Marketing Campaigns by following the steps below.

### Templates

1. Navigate to **Templates** in legacy Marketing Campaigns.
1. Select **Custom**.
1. Locate the template you wish to transfer into new Marketing Campaigns.
1. Click the action menu and then select **Export HTML**. The template HTML instantly downloads to the folder specified on your computer.

<call-out type="warning">

Images embedded in your templates or past campaigns will continue to populate from your legacy Marketing Campaigns image library. To ensure no images break in the future when legacy Marketing Campaigns is deprecated, consider updating links to pull images from your new Marketing Campaigns image library.

</call-out>

5. Navigate to **Templates** in new Marketing Campaigns and select **My Templates**.
6. Click **Create Template**, and then select either the **Design Editor** or the **Code Editor**.
7. If you’re using the **Design Editor**, navigate to **Build**, select **Advanced** and then click **Import Drag & Drop HTML**. If you’re using the **Code Editor**, paste in the HTML into the HTML editor.

<call-out> 

Switching from a template made in the Code Editor into a Design Editor can cause some unwanted changes. Sticking to the editor you started with can help keep this transfer smooth and prevent any formatting issues.

</call-out>

8. Paste the HTML you copied from the downloaded file into the code editor and then click **Save** if you are using the **Code Editor**. Click **Update** and then **Save** if you are using the **Design Editor** .

Make sure that you are using the new [substitution tags]({{root_url}}/ui/sending-email/editor/#using-substitution-tags). For example, instead of using ``[%first_name%]``, you will now use ``{{first_name}}``.

![]({{root_url}}/img/substitution-tag-comparison.png "substitution tag comparison")

<call-out> 

Make sure that your unsubscription tags and groups are also up to date. You can learn more about how to format these tags [here]({{root_url}}/ui/sending-email/create-and-manage-unsubscribe-groups/). 

</call-out>

### Campaign designs

You may have email designs from campaigns that you’d like to re-use in new Marketing Campaigns that aren’t saved as a standalone template. You can do so by exporting the email content from these campaigns and importing them as a template in new Marketing Campaigns.

*To navigate your campaign designs*:

1. Navigate to **Campaigns** in legacy Marketing Campaigns.
1 Locate the campaign you wish to migrate and hover over the action menu until the icons appear. Select the **Export HTML** icon. The campaign HTML downloads to the folder specified on your computer.
1. Navigate to the Automation or Single Sends dashboard.
1. Click into the Automation you want to edit and find the email you want to add the exported HTML to. For Single Sends, click directly into the email you want to add the exported HTML to.
1. Hover over the action menu and select **Add Email Content**.
1. Select **Blank Template**.
1. Select either the **Code Editor** or **Design Editor**. 
1. If you’re using the **Design Editor**, navigate to **Build**, select **Advanced** and then click **Import Drag & Drop HTML**. If you’re using the **Code Editor**, paste in the HTML.
1. Paste the HTML you copied from the downloaded file into the code editor and then click **Save** if you are using the **Code Editor** and **Update** and then **Save** if you are using the **Design Editor** .

<call-out>

Called Campaigns in legacy Newsletter, Single Sends is the new name for one-time, targeted marketing emails.

</call-out>

##  Updating integrations to the new Marketing Campaigns APIs

Like legacy Marketing Campaigns, the new Marketing Campaigns experience offers APIs so you can programmatically manage your marketing emails. Today, you can manage contacts and Single Sends, with additional APIs for Segmentation and Automation [coming soon]({{root_url}}/ui/sending-email/coming-soon-to-new-marketing-campaigns/). 

Take a look at the table below for links to the API reference pages for legacy and new Marketing Campaigns respectively. The third column describes the action required to update your integrations from legacy to new Marketing Campaigns

## Using the APIs to migrate contacts and content to new Marketing Campaigns

You can leverage the APIs to programmatically manage much of your migration to new Marketing Campaigns by following the guidance below.

### Contacts

**Recreate Lists**

Use the legacy Marketing Campaigns API call [Retrieve all Lists](https://sendgrid.api-docs.io/v3.0/contacts-api-lists/retrieve-all-lists) to determine the list names to recreate in the new Marketing Campaigns. Then, use new Marketing Campaigns API call [Create List](https://sendgrid.api-docs.io/v3.0/lists/create-list) in the new experience. The values this call returns, particularly `‘id’`, are necessary for the recipient migration API.

**Recreate Custom Fields**

Use the legacy Marketing Campaigns API call to [Retrieve all Custom Fields](https://sendgrid.api-docs.io/v3.0/contactdb/custom_field) to determine the custom field necessary to recreate in new Marketing Campaigns. Use new Marketing Campaigns API call to create [Custom Field](https://sendgrid.api-docs.io/v3.0/custom-fields/create-custom-field-definition) in the new Marketing Campaigns API. Pass in the corresponding `‘name’` and `‘field_type’` from the legacy Marketing Campaigns GET call. The values this call returns, particularly `‘id’`, are necessary for the recipient migration API.

**Migrate Recipients**

Use the legacy Marketing Campaigns API call to [Retrieve all Recipients](https://sendgrid.api-docs.io/v3.0/contactdb/recipients) to recreate in new Marketing Campaigns. We recommend using pagination and iterating through all of the pages until you receive a `404 ‘no pages’` error. You will receive a response to return all contacts. The values this call returns, particularly `‘id’`, will be necessary for the recipient migration API. Iterate through all the recipients to get lists this recipient is on. Store the list(s) you wish to add your recipients onto in the new Marketing Campaigns, otherwise, recipients will add onto `‘All Contacts’` by default. Custom Field values and list(s) a recipient is on uses this data and calls [add contacts](https://sendgrid.api-docs.io/v3.0/contacts/add-or-update-a-contact) to the new experience. It is important to note: 

1. Custom Fields pass as an object with key value pairs as
 
    `{ “id_1” : “value_1”, “id_2” : “value_2” }`

    and **not** as the name of the new Marketing Campaigns Custom Field.

2. This call allows for batching of recipients. It is recommended to add at least 1,000 recipients per API request.
3. You can omit `‘list_ids’` if your recipient is not uploaded to any lists, as it is optional.

In addition to offering faster performance, increased scale, and improved stability, the new Marketing Campaigns also offers net-new functionality. 

*Automation*

Create a recurring email or series of emails that send automatically whenever a contact joins a list. Choose when each email sends, and whether a contact should exit the automation if they no longer meet the entry criteria. [Learn More]({{root_url}}/ui/sending-email/getting-started-with-automation/). 

*Email Testing* 

Have confidence your emails are flawless with integrated email testing. See how emails render across the inboxes, browsers, and device types that matter to your business, ensure links within your email are valid and know how your email will perform against the most powerful spam filters. [Learn more]({{root_url}}/ui/sending-email/email-testing/). 

*Signup Forms* 

Capture new signups and add them directly to your new Marketing Campaigns contacts. These forms can be embedded directly on your website or shared via a Twilio SendGrid-hosted URL. [Learn  more]({{root_url}}/ui/managing-contacts/create-and-manage-contacts/#create-a-signup-form). 

*Familiar features and functionality from legacy*
 
These new features build on the functionality you’re used to in legacy Marketing Campaigns. This means after a few simple migration steps, you’ll be up and running quickly thanks to familiar workflows you already know.  

**Can I try the new Marketing Campaigns for free?**

Yes! By default, you have access to the new Marketing Campaigns Free package in your account. It gives you access to all features, including Automation, so you can test fully. If you do not see the new Marketing Campaigns in your account, please contact support as you may need to make a change to your account due to an outdated plan type. 

**What happens to my legacy Marketing Campaigns account if I try new Marketing Campaigns?**

There is no impact to your legacy Marketing Campaigns account by testing or upgrading to new Marketing Campaigns. When you upgrade to either the new Basic or Advanced package, you’ll be given a grace period to support your migration from legacy to new Marketing Campaigns. During this time, you will not be charged for contact storage in legacy Marketing Campaigns. 

Once the grace period has ended, you’ll be charged for any contacts over the free allotment of 2,000 in your legacy Marketing Campaigns storage. 

**I don’t see the new Marketing Campaigns in my account. What should I do?**

If you do not see the new Marketing Campaigns in your account, please contact support to troubleshoot why you do not have access. 

**I have more than 200,000 contacts. What should I do?**

To purchase a new Marketing Campaigns package above the Advanced 200K plan, please [contact our sales team](https://sendgrid.com/contact-us-form/).

**Are there services to help me with migration?**

Yes. There is a paid service where our experts will help get you quickly and successfully migrated to the new Marketing Campaigns. They’ll review your email marketing program, provide migration support, and teach you what you need to know to hit the ground running with the new Marketing Campaigns. [Learn more about this migration service](https://go.sendgrid.com/Marketing-Campaigns-Launch.html).

**I have dedicated IP(s) I’ve already warmed up. What happens to them?**

No changes will be made to your existing dedicated IPs unless you lose access by downgrading your Email API plan to Essentials or Free. If you choose an Advanced Marketing Campaigns plan, you’ll be granted a new, additional dedicated IP address. This will need to be [warmed up]({{root_url}}/ui/sending-email/ip-warmup-for-the-new-marketing-campaigns-experience/) to ensure a positive sender reputation. 

Email that you send from new Marketing Campaigns will be sent across all dedicated IPs you have for your account or subuser. You can choose to assign specific IPs to individual [subusers]({{root_url}}/ui/account-and-settings/subusers/#adding-subusers-to-dedicated-ip-addresses) to segment your sending across specific IP addresses.
