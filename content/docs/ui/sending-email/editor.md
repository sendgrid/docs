  description: SendGrid Marketing Campaigns' editing gives you complete control over your emails. Use a flexible drag-and-drop Design editor or a robust HTML code editor.
---

The new Marketing Campaigns experience is all about supporting your unique workflow, so you can get your work done more efficiently. You have complete control over the way that you create and edit each new email, thanks to 2 distinct editing experiences.

## Choosing The Right Editor

The [**Code Editor**](#the-code-editor) is perfect for users who are importing, creating, or editing custom HTML. It offers a robust environment to upload images, backed by a feature-packed editor – complete with split-screen preview, error flagging, scroll-syncing, syntax highlighting, and more. While other email editors may be notorious for adding excess code to your project, rest assured that our editor never modifies your carefully crafted HTML.

The [**Design Editor**](#the-design-editor), complete with HTML access to each content module, offers powerful “what you see is what you get” (WYSIWYG) editing. It features a diverse library of content blocks, allowing you to build beautiful emails quickly and intuitively. Once placed into your email, each module offers access to edit the HTML and a robust panel of settings – perfect for customizing content precisely to your needs.

<call-out>

The [Design Editor](#the-design-editor) features a number of convenient ways to edit the HTML content of your email –– including the ability to [edit the HTML of each drag-and-drop module](#editing-module-html), [edit the HTML `head` of your message](#editing-the-html-head), and even import complete code using our [Drag & Drop Markup](#importing-custom-html-with-drag--drop-markup).

## The Code Editor

SendGrid’s marketer-friendly code editor features a powerful split-screen editing experience – perfect for building single send or automation emails with your own custom HTML. It offers a number of helpful features, often found in native editors.

### Code Editor Features

**Live Template Preview** -
See how your email looks in real-time as you write and edit code. No more tabbing between windows, refreshing, or re-rendering. Marketing Campaigns’ split-screen editing experience displays your code on the left and a pixel-perfect preview on the right.

**Code & Tag Completion** -
As you type, the editor automatically makes common suggestions. You can accept them by tapping tab or return –– or, simply continue typing to ignore. Additionally, as you open a tag of any kind, the code editor automatically places a closing tag.

**Error Flagging** -
If the code editor finds something that seems odd or inconsistent with best practices, instead of interrupting your workflow, it places a small red “x” in the margin of the line so you can come back and check when it’s convenient for you.

**Scroll Syncing** -
Easily pinpoint the HTML element you wish to edit. Click anywhere on the right-side preview of your email, and the code on the left automatically jumps to the corresponding line. Click somewhere on the left, and the preview on the right will jump along with you!

**Syntax Highlighting** -
As you edit, parts of your code highlights in various colors according to the type of syntax. This added dimension provides clarity and efficiency as you search for, locate, and edit code elements.

<table class="table" style="table-layout:fixed">
 <tr>
   <th>Substitution Tag</th>
   <th>Description</th>
   <th>Type</th>
 </tr>
 <tr>
   <td><code class="language-text">{{email}}</code></td>
   <td>The email address of the recipient</td>
 </tr>
 <tr>
   <td><code class="language-text">{{first_name}}</code></td>
   <td>The first name of the recipient</td>
 </tr>
 <tr>
   <td><code class="language-text">{{last_name}}</code></td>
   <td>The last name of the recipient</td>
 </tr>
 <tr>
   <td><code class="language-text"><{{sender_name}}></code>* </td>
   <td>The name of the sender selected when sending your email</td>
 </tr>
 <tr>
   <td><code class="language-text"><{{sender_city}}></code>* </td>
   <td>The city on record for the sender selected when sending your email</td>
 </tr>

   <td>The zip code on record for the sender selected when sending your email</td>
 </tr>
 <tr>
   <td><code class="language-text">{{unsubscribe}}</code>* </td>
   <td>This tag is replaced with a link allowing your recipients opt out of any emails you send using the chosen Unsubscribe Group.</td>
 </tr>
 <tr>
   <td><code class="language-text">{{unsubscribe_</br>preferences}}</code>
   * </td>
   <td>This tag is replaced with a link allowing your recipients to opt out of any email unsubscribe groups you offer.</td>
 </tr>
</table>

&ast; For your convenience, these substitution tags are included by default in the Unsubscribe Module found on the Tags tab of the Design Editor.

<call-out type="warning">

The `<%asm_group_unsubscribe_raw_url%>`, `<%asm_preferences_raw_url%>`, and `<%asm_global_unsubscribe
_raw_url%>` tags are reserved for use in Transactional Templates and should not be used in Marketing Campaigns.

</call-out>

<call-out>

For contacts with no entry in a custom field, the substitution tag appears blank. To set a default value, use the following pattern:

`{{first_name | Valued Customer}}`

</call-out>

### Previewing Your Email

To preview your email or template, click the **Preview** button in the upper-left corner.

You can toggle between a mobile and desktop preview mode by clicking either the desktop or mobile phone icons above the content area.

To view a plain-text version of your email or template, click the **T** icon. When in this preview mode, you can edit the plain text content of your email or template by clicking the **Edit Plain Text** button.

When previewing an email, you also see a preview of the From name, the Subject, and the preheader text that you have selected.

### Editing the HTML Head

The HTML `<head>` element is where you can define any metadata you would like to include with your email or template. For example, you can use the `<head>` element to define any custom fonts or CSS styles you would like to use.

*To edit the HTML head of your email or template:*

1. Navigate to the **Build** tab in the left-hand toolbar and scroll to the **Advanced** menu.
1. Expand the option titled **Edit HTML Head**.
1. Click  **Edit** to begin editing your HTML head.
   <br>A window appears where you can insert your custom HTML.
1. Once you've finished making your changes, click the **Update** button.


#### Adding Custom Fonts Using the HTML Head

Most commonly, users add custom fonts by using the <link> tag to reference a web font hosted somewhere on the internet. For example, [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com).

<call-out type="warning">

Make sure that you define a web-safe font to use as a fallback if one of your recipient’s clients does not support your custom font.

</call-out>

While some inbox providers do not support web fonts, the following popular clients do provide web font support:

* Apple Mail
* Outlook.com app
* Outlook 2000
* Default Android Mail app (not the Android Gmail app)
* iOS Mail

This list may change and we cannot guarantee 100% support from any of these clients.

*To add a custom font using the HTML head:*

1. Open the HTML Head by navigating to the **Build** tab in the design editor.
1. Scroll down to the **Advanced** drop-down menu and select **Edit HTML Head**.
1. Click **Edit** to begin making your changes.
1. Insert a `<link>` tag containing an href attribute pointing to your web font.

For example:
```html
<link href="https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Oswald" rel="stylesheet">
```

Next, you’ll have to add a `<style>` to specify that you want to use this new font family:

```html
<style>
    body {
        font-family: 'Oswald',
        sans-serif;
    
</style>
```

### Importing Custom HTML With Drag & Drop Markup

If you are writing your own custom HTML that you plan on importing into the design editor, refer to the [drag & drop code examples](#drag--drop-code-examples) to ensure that any modules you create are compatible with our drag & drop functionality. If you do not specify a data type that matches one of our drag & drop modules, your code is imported as a text module.

*To import custom HTML:*

1. Navigate to the **Build** tab in the left-hand navigation.
2. Scroll down and select the **Advanced** drop-down menu.
3. Expand the option titled **Import/Export**.
4. Click **Import**.
   <br>A window opens where you can paste in your own HTML.

  ![]({{root_url}}/img/import_custom_html.png "Import custom HTML")

5. Paste or enter the HTML you want to use and then click **Import**.

<call-out type="warning">

Any HTML that you import replaces all existing content in your email or template. If you want to import only a section of HTML, use a [code module](#code-modules).

</call-out>

### Drag & Drop Markup

SendGrid parses your custom HTML, looking for any [drag & drop compatible modules](#drag--drop-code-examples).

  * First, we look for any HTML elements that contain the attribute `role="modules-container"`.
  * Next, we look for all HTML elements with the attribute `role="module"` that are descendants of the "modules-container" element.

The `role="modules-container"` attribute is required so that we know where your drag and drop modules are located. All of the SendGrid pre-built templates include the `role="modules-container"` by default. You are only required to include this attribute when creating an email or template from scratch that you want to be compatible with the design editor.

<call-out type="warning">


Any HTML outside an element with the "modules-container" attribute is discarded. Only [supported styling options and attributes](#drag--drop-module-descriptions-and-styles) are included.

If you don't include the "modules-container" attribute in any of your custom HTML, then all of your HTML is imported as a single text module.


</call-out>

Following is an example of how you should structure and organize your custom HTML, where [module content] represents the content of your modules.

### Drag & Drop Code Examples

<code-group langs="Image,Image & Text,text,code,columns,button,divider,spacer,social">

```image
<table class="wrapper" role="module" data-type="image">
  <tr>
    <td [styles go here] align=['left' or 'right']>
      [MODULE CONTENT]
    </td>
  </tr>
```

```image & text
  <table role="module" data-type="imagetext">
    <tr>
      <td>
        <table>
          <tr role="module-content">
            <td class="templateColumnContainer" >
              <table>
                <tr>

### Exporting HTML From the Design Editor

*To export template HTML from the design editor:*

1. Navigate to the **Build** tab in the left-hand navigation.
1. Scroll down and select the **Advanced** drop-down menu.
1. Expand the option titled **Import/Export**.
   <br>This starts the raw HTML download of the template, excluding images.

SendGrid hosts the images included in the pre-built templates and any images you have uploaded to the image library, so when you export a template’s HTML from the design editor, the embedded URLs in each `<img>` tag remains valid.

*To open exported HTML in the code editor using Single Sends:*

1. From the left-hand navigation, select **Marketing** and then click **Single Sends**.
1. Click **New Campaign** and then select **Blank Template**.
1. Select **Code Editor**.
1. Paste the raw SendGrid template HTML into the code editor.

*To open exported HTML in the code editor using Automations:*

1. From the left-hand navigation, select **Marketing** and then click **Automations**.
1. Click **Create an Automation** and then navigate to *Custom Automation* and click **Select**.
1. Navigate to the first email in the Automation series and click **Edit Email Content**.
1. Locate the blank template and click **Select**.  
1. Select **Code Editor**.
1. Paste the raw SendGrid template HTML into the code editor.

### Adding Categories to Single Sends

Assigning categories to a single send allows you to track emails based on your own categorization system. By assigning your single send to a category, you can track statistics across multiple similar single sends and automations. Example categories: “Weekly Digest,” “Product Announcements.”

*To add a category:*

1. Navigate to the *Settings* tab and click **Single Send Settings** to expand the menu.
1. Find the *Categories* field.
1. Enter the name of a new category or select a previously used category from the drop-down menu.

### Email Testing

Email testing offers robust, pre-send testing of your emails, including in-app spam testing, inbox rendering previews, and link validation right within your Marketing Campaigns workflow. It allows you to preview how an email is likely to perform across a wide range of inbox providers, devices and spam filters, before sending.
