## 	Limitations

 ### 	v3 Mail Send

The total message size of emails sent via the [v3 mail send endpoint]({{root_url}}/API_Reference/Web_API_v3/Mail/index.html) is limited to 20MB. This includes all headers, the body, and attachments. That means
that the maximum attachment size depends on the size of the rest of the
stuff in your message, but we do recommend that your attachments do not exceed 10MB.

 ### 	v2 Mail Send

The total message size of emails sent via the [v2 mail send endpoint]({{root_url}}/API_Reference/Web_API/mail.html) is limited to 20,480,000 bytes, or approximately
19.5MB. This includes all headers, the body, and attachments. We recommend that your attachments do not exceed 7MB.

<call-out>

Keep in mind that the size of your file on disk or in memory may
not be the same as the size of the file once it is attached, as files must
be encoded as text to be sent. You can expect an increase in size of up
to 30%.

## 	Best Practices

Attachments are in and of themselves potential risks when sending email.
Email filters are more likely to prevent delivery of a message that has an attachment
due to the risk of viruses.

A good alternative to attaching a file to your message is to place it on a page of your website,
and then provide a link to that web page within your message body.
