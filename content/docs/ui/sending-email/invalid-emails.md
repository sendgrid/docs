An invalid email occurs when you attempt to send email to an address that is formatted in a manner that does not meet internet email format standards or the email does not exist at the recipient's mail server. Examples include addresses without the “@” sign or addresses that include certain special characters and/or spaces. This response can come from our own server or the recipient mail server.

Before you send, SendGrid does a check against the format of the email address to attempt to verify its validity. If the recipient server checks the address and doesn't find it, they will send back a 550 bounce to say that this is an invalid email address.

The list provided here can be filtered by email address or date.

## 	Searching Invalid Emails by Date

In the top right corner, you will see a calendar icon. Click this and choose the dates you would like to search between. Your recipient list will refresh, showing the invalid email address reports from between those dates.

## 	Removing Recipients From The List

When you select the checkboxes next to the recipient names or select all, using the checkbox next to the search box, you will see a new button at the top of the page. From this list, you can choose to remove the selected recipients from the list.

## 	Download Invalid Emails as CSV

You can download your list as a CSV by clicking the gear icon at the top of the page and selecting “Download CSV.” The file will download in your browser right away.
