Marketing Campaigns templates determine how the content of your campaign will be built and displayed to your recipients. Templates also serve as a quick starting point for future campaigns by saving you time from having to rebuild your campaign's layout. Consequently, templates allow you to reuse content and maintain brand consistency across all of your campaign efforts.

We provide a collection of pre-built, responsive templates that you may begin using and customizing immediately, or you can create your own template from scratch.


 ## 	Creating a New Template

*To create a new template:*

1. From the left-hand navigation, select **Campaigns**, and then select **Templates**.
2. Click **Create New Template**.
3. Select the editor you want to use, and then click **Continue**.

<call-out>

Developers can use the [POST /campaigns API](https://sendgrid.api-docs.io/v3.0/campaigns-api/create-a-campaign) to programmatically upload a template that you can then go in and edit using the Marketing Campaigns application.

 ## 	Editing an Existing Template

You can only edit custom templates (templates that you have created yourself or duplicated from a SendGrid pre-built template).

*To edit a template:*

1. From the left-hand navigation, select **Marketing Campaigns**, and then click **Templates**.

   If you wish to create a custom template using either drag and drop or entering your HTML, select **BLANK TEMPLATE**.

1. Navigate to the template you want to edit. 
1. Click the **action menu** and select **Edit**.

   This navigates you to the editor originally used to create the campaign. After you create a template, you cannot switch between the design and code editor. However, if you choose the design editor you'll still have HTML editing options, and with the code editor you'll enjoy convenient visual tools like side-by-side code and preview panes.

You can easily duplicate a pre-built template provided by SendGrid.

*To duplicate a SendGrid template:*

1. Select **Duplicate**. The duplicate opens in the design editor.
