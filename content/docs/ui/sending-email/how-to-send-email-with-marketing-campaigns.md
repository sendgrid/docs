This page refers to the new Marketing Campaigns product. If you’re using legacy Marketing Campaigns, your workflow will be a little different and your screen won’t look the same as the screenshots.

</call-out>

<call-out>

If you want to send email programmatically using Twilio SendGrid's Email API, see the [API reference]({{root_url}}/api-reference/) or the [SMTP Reference]({{root_url}}/for-developers/sending-email/getting-started-smtp/).

</call-out>

##     Before you send your first email with Marketing Campaigns

<call-out type="warning">

Before you begin, go to your SendGrid [account settings](https://app.sendgrid.com/settings/account) to verify that your timezone and account email address are correct. Verifying your account information ensures that when you upload contacts, you receive notifications and that we deliver scheduled email at the right time. You can also add additional email addresses to receive account notifications by going to the Marketing page and selecting **Notifications**. From Notifications, you can add a different email address to which we will send important account notifications, like contact export activity.

</call-out>

###  Change your time zone

Your time zone is set at the account level, you’ll need to navigate to your account settings to change it. 


1. Near the bottom of the left-hand navigation, select **Settings**.
1. Click **Account Details**, or go [here](https://app.sendgrid.com/settings/account).
1. Locate the *Timezone* field under **Your Account**, and correct it if necessary.

### Add a sender

Specifying a [sender]({{root_url}}/ui/sending-email/senders/) in Marketing Campaigns is required by CAN-SPAM regulations, and provides identity information about where the emails are coming from in each email you send.

When you add a sender, you need to specify the following information:

- **From name** - the name of the person or company you wish to send email from.
- **From email** - the email of the person or company you wish to send email from.
- **Reply to email** - the email address of the person or company you want recipients to reply to. (Can also be a role address.)
- **Company address** - the physical location of the business you’re sending email on behalf of.
- **City** - the city of the business you're sending email on behalf of.
- **Nickname** - the nickname is for your reference only; this field will not be displayed to recipients.

<call-out>

If your email domain doesn't match one of your [authenticated]({{root_url}}/ui/account-and-settings/how-to-set-up-domain-authentication/) domains, you'll need to verify this email address before using this sender. We'll send this email address a verification email after you save this sender.

</call-out>


### Add Contacts

Marketing Campaigns offers a number of ways to add contacts to lists, including:

- [**Signup Forms**]({{root_url}/ui/managing-contacts/create-and-manage-contacts/#create-a-signup-form/)

![]({{root_url}}/img/sign-up-form.png "Sign Up Form")

- [**CSV Upload**]({{root_url}}/ui/managing-contacts/create-and-manage-contacts/#upload-a-csv/) 

- [**Manually Adding a Contact**]({{root_url}/https://sendgrid.com/docs/ui/managing-contacts/create-and-manage-contacts/#add-manually)

- [**Contact Management APIs**](https://sendgrid-marketing-campaigns-beta.api-docs.io/v1)
 
<call-out type="warning">

Adding contacts to a list that's designated as the entry criteria for an automation will trigger that automation.

</call-out>

### Add an Unsubscribe Group

[Unsubscribe Groups]({{root_url}}/ui/sending-email/create-and-manage-unsubscribe-groups/) provide your recipients with an alternative to opting out of all email that you send, by giving them the opportunity to specify the kinds of email that they would no longer like to receive.

1. Navigate to **Marketing** and click **Unsubscribe Groups**.
1. Click **Add Unsubscribe Groups** if you do not already have any unsubscribe groups, or click **Create New Group** to add a new group.

<call-out type="warning">

The Group Name as well as the Group Description are public-facing and will be visible to your recipients.

</call-out>

4. Select the checkbox if you want the Unsubscribe Group to display on the unsubscribe preferences page.
5. Click **Save Unsubscribe Group**.
6. Find your newly created Unsubscribe Group, click the action menu, and then click **Preview**.

### Create Notifications

By default, notifications about your account's Marketing Campaigns activity, CSV upload summaries, sender verifications, and list or segment exports will send to the email you signed up with on your parent account. You can also opt in to receive email notifications from SendGrid to up to 10 email addresses by following the instructions [here]({{root_url}}/ui/account-and-settings/notifications/).

## Creating a Single Send

1. From the left-hand navigation, select **Marketing**.
1. Select **Single Sends**. 
1. To create a new one-to-many email, click **Create Single Send**. 
1. Select the template that you want to use for your email.
<br> You can select a blank template, a custom template that you have already created, or one of SendGrid's responsive pre-built templates. For more information, see [Marketing Templates]({{root_url}}/ui/sending-email/working-with-marketing-templates/).
1. Select an editor.
<br> You can choose between the **Design Editor** and the **Code Editor**.

![]({{root_url}}/img/choose-editor.png)

<call-out>

The [**Design Editor**]({{root_url}}/ui/sending-email/editor/#the-design-editor) offers users powerful drag & drop editing tools, making it possible to build beautiful emails using a library of content modules like text boxes,images, buttons and more. For those familiar with HTML, there are options to edit the HTML of individual modules, drag in a custom code module, or to import an entire HTML email with drag & drop markup.

The [**Code Editor**]({{root_url}}/ui/sending-email/editor/#the-code-editor) provides users who are importing, editing, or crafting custom HTML a robust, IDE-like environment, featuring side-by-side code and preview panes, syntax highlighting, code completion, and image management.

</call-out>

Inside the Design Editor, you use the **Settings**, **Tags** and **Build** tabs to design and configure your email.
Inside the Code Editor, you can click the left **Settings** tab to expand the settings window, and then you can configure your email using the **Settings** and **Tags** tabs.

![]({{root_url}}/img/design-editor-preview.png "Design Editor Preview")

6. Define key settings like *From Sender*, *Email Subject*, *Preheader*, *Recipients*, and *Scheduling* by filling in the fields in the **Settings** tab.

<call-out type="warning">

Please note that only some special characters are allowed in email addresses. Without quotes, local-parts of an email address may consist of any combination of alphabetic characters, digits, or any of the following special characters: 

 ```
 ! # $ % & ' * + - / = ?  ^ _ . { | } ~ `
 ```

 A period (".") may also appear, but may not be used to start or end the local part, nor may two or more consecutive periods appear.

</call-out>

7. Add your custom content by clicking the **Build** tab in the Design Editor, or by editing the HTML code in the Code Editor. 

![]({{root_url}}/img/build-tab.png "Build tab")

<call-out> 

Make sure to include the [{{{unsubscribe}}}]({{root_url}}/ui/sending-email/create-and-manage-unsubscribe-groups/) tag to test and send your campaign.

For more information about customizing your campaign, see [Using the Design Editor]({{root_url}}/ui/sending-email/editor/#the-design-editor) or [Using the Code Editor]({{root_url}}/ui/sending-email/editor/#the-code-editor).

</call-out>

## Sending your First Email

1. Once you’ve finished editing your email, you can see what it looks like by saving your draft, hovering over the action menu, and then clicking **Preview**.


At this time, you are unable to send a test email. However you can use our [Email Testing]({{root_url}}/ui/sending-email/email-testing) feature to test your email across different devices and platforms. It allows you to preview how an email is likely to perform across a wide range of inbox providers, devices and spam filters, before sending.

![]({{root_url}}/img/email-testing-full.png "Email Testing")

2. If you haven't already, return to **Settings** to select which contacts will receive your email by clicking the **Send To** field under **Recipients**.

<call-out type="warning">

Recipients on a list or segment **will receive** an email if they are on the list or segment before the email sends and after an email is scheduled to send. The email will send to all contacts on the specified list or segment at the time of sending the email. If possible, avoid scheduling for the top of the hour or half-hour to avoid the busiest times for your recipients' inboxes. Sending at 10:53, for example, can help increase engagement.
