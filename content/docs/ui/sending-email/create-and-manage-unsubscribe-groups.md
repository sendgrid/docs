## Adding an Unsubscribe Group to your Email

*Using the Design Editor:*

1. Select your preferred Unsubscribe Group by clicking **Settings** and selecting the group from **Recipients**.
1. From the **Build** tab, drag the **Unsubscribe** module to insert Sender Information and a link to the `{{{unsubscribe}}}` tag.
1. To manually hyperlink to the {{unsubscribe}} tag, enter the text you would like to link.
1. Highlight the text then select the link icon from the top toolbar.
1. In the URL field enter `{{{unsubscribe}}}`, then click **Save**.

*Using the Code Editor:*

1. Select your preferred Unsubscribe Group by navigating to **Settings** and then selecting **Recipients**.
1. Enter the following code styling to the HTML window where you would like your unsubscribe content placed:

```
<a href="{{{unsubscribe}}}">Click here to unsubscribe.</a>
```

## Using a Custom Unsubscribe Link

While SendGrid Unsubscribe Groups are a powerful way to manage unsubscribes and email preferences, we realize some senders may have their own subscription management tools. For these senders, Marketing Campaigns supports custom unsubscribe links as well.

If you would like to use a custom URL for your unsubscribe link, navigate to **Settings** in the left-hand sidebar and select the **Recipients** dropdown menu. Under **Unsubscribe Group**, select **Use Custom Link...**

This will expand a new field where you can insert a URL for one of your own pages where recipients can manage their subscription preferences.

To place your Custom Unsubscribe link into your email, highlight any text within the body of your email and click the small link icon to specify a hyperlink. In the URL field that appears, enter the tag `{{{Unsubscribe}}}`. Since you've specified your Custom Unsubscribe Link in the Settings panel, SendGrid will replace the Unsubscribe Tag with your custom URL.

## Add recipients to an Unsubscribe Group

You can add recipients to an unsubscribe group by uploading a CSV or adding them manually using the UI. To programmatically add recipients to an unsubscribe group, see our [API documentation](https://sendgrid.api-docs.io/v3.0/suppressions-unsubscribe-groups)
