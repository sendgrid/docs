Parent accounts will see aggregated statistics for their account and all subuser accounts. Subuser accounts will only see their own statistics.

The browser statistics report you which browsers, such as Safari, Firefox and Chrome, that your recipients use to view your email.

<call-out>

There are similarities between Device and Browser statistics and we are working on ways to consolidate the data. The current reasoning for two separate reports is that in some cases an open from a device can result with a click from a browser that represents the device (e.g. Open on an Iphone -> Click on an Iphone), in other cases an open from one device can result in a click from a different browser (e.g. an Open on a desktop computer -> Click on FireFox).

</call-out>

Choose a browser from the list to see statistics about how your recipients interact with your email based on the application they use to look at the internet.

The actual statistics included vary depending upon [your account settings]({{root_url}}/ui/account-and-settings/account/). Emails sent, bounces and spam reports will always get tracked. Unsubscribes, clicks, and opens require that the associated settings are enabled.

You can change which metrics, date, or grouping by adjusting the [statistics filters]({{root_url}}/ui/analytics-and-reporting/stats-overview/#statistics-filters).

## 	Figures

The figures table gives you all of the specific counts or percentages of each event, according to how youâ€™ve grouped your statistics (day, week, or month). For example, if you wanted to see what percentage of the emails you sent were actually opened on the second week of April based on the browser, this is a great place to look.

This table will refresh with new or adjusted data based on the various filters available at the top of the page. You can also choose to show actual counts or percentages, by clicking the corresponding button above and to the right of the table.
