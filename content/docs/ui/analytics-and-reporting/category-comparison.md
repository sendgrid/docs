Categories can help organize your email analytics by enabling you to “tag” emails by type. As a result, you may want to compare one category to another. The category comparison tool allows you to do this.

## 	Select Your Categories

You can compare up to 10 categories at a time. To select them, click the **+** sign next to each category name in the left-side list. Then, click **Compare**.

## 	Comparison Overview

Once you have selected the categories, your top most graph will show you how each selected category has fared for each individual metric in a single graph. Each category will be assigned a color in this bar chart.

You can remove individual categories from the list of categories you selected initially, by clicking **Categories** and unchecking categories. The graph will refresh, showing only the selected categories.

You can change which metrics, date, or grouping by adjusting the [statistics filters]({{root_url}}/ui/analytics-and-reporting/stats-overview/#statistics-filters).

## 	Individual Metrics Comparison

When you initially choose the categories to compare, this graph will be titled “Comparison for Deliveries” and will show you the delivery rates over time for each of the compared categories.

You can remove individual categories from the list of categories you selected initially, by clicking **Categories** and unchecking categories. The graph will refresh, showing only the selected categories.

To change this graph to see another metric for your categories, click the button next to the Categories button and choose another metric.

## 	Individual Metrics Figures

When you initially choose the categories to compare, this table will be titled “Figures for Delivered” and will show you the actual delivery numbers over time for each of the compared categories.

You can remove individual categories from the list of categories you selected initially, by clicking **Categories** and unchecking categories. The graph will refresh, showing only the selected categories.

To change this graph to see another metric, click the button inline with the graph title and choose another metric.

You can also choose to show actual counts or percentages, by clicking the corresponding button above and to the right of the table.
