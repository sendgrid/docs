Browser information can help optimize your email sending by showing you how different browser usage affects how your recipients interact with your email. As a result, you may want to compare one browser’s statistics to another to see differences or to see if a recent change has made an improvement. The browser comparison tool allows you to do this. You can change which metrics, date, or grouping by adjusting the [statistics filters]({{root_url}}/ui/analytics-and-reporting/stats-overview/#statistics-filters).

## 	Comparison Overview

Your top most graph will show you how each selected browser has fared for the selected individual metric in the donut graph.

## 	Individual Metrics Comparison

This graph will show you the browser statistics for the selected metric. To change the metric, select it from the button at the top of the page.

You can remove individual browsers from the graph by clicking the button above and to the right of this chart and unchecking the boxes next to the browser name. The graph will refresh, showing only the statistics for the selected browser.

## 	Individual Metrics Figures

This table is titled “Figures for Delivered” and shows you the actual delivery numbers over time for each of the compared browsers.

You can also choose to show actual counts or percentages, by clicking the corresponding button above and to the right of the table.
