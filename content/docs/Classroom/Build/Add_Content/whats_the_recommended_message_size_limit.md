The total message size should not exceed  **20MB.** This includes the message itself, headers, and the combined size of any attachments. 

Using this limit will give you the best chance of not hitting server-side size limits as well, as many mail servers will have varying policies when it comes to the size of messages they will accept. 

 

This same size limit applies when sending messages to our Parse API webhook, 20mb or under, if you please!
