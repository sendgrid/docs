Mail Transfer Agent or Message Transfer Agent (MTA) is software that transfers electronic mail messages from one computer to another using a client–server application architecture.

An MTA implements both the client (sending) and server (receiving) portions of the [Simple Mail Transfer Protocol]({{root_url}}/Glossary/smtp.html).
