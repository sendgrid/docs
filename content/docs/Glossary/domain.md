A domain is a named Internet address that resolves to the numbered Internet Protocol (IP) addresses computers use to connect. Examples: sendgrid.com, yourdomain.com, google.com. Simply put, it’s the web address your users type into their browser to learn about your company.

If you are on a Pro 100k or above plan you will have your very own dedicated IP address which we encourage you to [whitelabel your server for sending with SendGrid]({{root_url}}/User_Guide/Setting_Up_Your_Server/Whitelabeling/index.html)
