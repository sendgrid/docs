Email authentication refers to technical standards that help ISPs and other receivers validate the identity of an email sender. There are three authentication standards in use: [SPF]({{root_url}}/glossary/spf/) developed by AOL, [Sender ID]({{root_url}}/glossary/sender-id/) developed by Microsoft and [DKIM]({{root_url}}/glossary/dkim/) developed by Yahoo!.
