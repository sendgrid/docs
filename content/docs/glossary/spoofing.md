Spoofing is a technique where forged email addresses are used to trick recipients into opening an email because the originating source has been hidden. This deceptive tactic can be used to spread viruses or other malicious programs, and is frequently used in conjunction with phishing emails. Spoofed emails are often sent out, pretending to be legitimate companies, in an attempt to steal your account information by having you click a link and enter your account credentials.

If you have been tricked by a phishing email sent via SendGrid, please contact [SendGrid Support](https://support.sendgrid.com). No matter who sent the phishing email, you can file a report with the [Federal Trade Commission](http://www.ftc.gov/complaint)

If we find that a SendGrid customer is sending spoofed or phishing emails, we will ban their account immediately.
