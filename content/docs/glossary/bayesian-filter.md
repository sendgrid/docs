This is a statistical method for determining the probability that an email is spam by looking for the use of words or phrases commonly associated with spam email.

A Bayesian filter detects spam by comparing the words or phrases within the questionable email to a set of known words or phrases associated with spam. Bayesian filtering has a very low rate of false positives and is a tried and true method for filtering spam.
