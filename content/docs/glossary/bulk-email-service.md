A bulk email service allows you to send email communications to large lists of multiple recipients by incorporating email into your applications. You can send one email to many people, or a unique email to each person on your list with a bulk email service. Depending on the provider, you can send unique emails to each recipient by providing a template for substituting information (such as a name).

Commonly, bulk email is used for newsletters or marketing email. If you have a list of customers or prospects, you can send them content relevant to their business or interest, from a single application. A bulk email service allows you to send to any list, regardless of its size. The frequency at which you send is entirely up to you, and should be based on what the recipients expect. Your engagement data, including spam reports, unsubscribes, and open and click rates, will tell you whether your message is hitting the mark.

SendGrid is a bulk email service for both marketing email and transactional email (single emails triggered by actions within your application). SendGrid's [bulk transactional email pricing](https://sendgrid.com/pricing?mc=SendGrid%20Documentation) and [bulk email marketing pricing](https://sendgrid.com/pricing?mc=SendGrid%20Documentation) are based on the volume of email you send, not the size of your list. SendGrid provides valuable insights across your entire email program:

* Deliverability rate to ensure your email is getting to the recipient's server
* Open and click tracking to measure engagement
* Webhook to notify your application of bounces, unsubscribes, and spam reports

The bulk email service can be enabled with minimal changes to your application. At the basic level, simply point your SMTP settings to our server and SendGrid will take care of the rest. You can also use our Web API or SMTP API to more deeply integrate into your system.

The marketing email service allows non-technical users to send bulk newsletters and other bulk emails using a drag-and-drop interface. List management and all aspects of the service are also available via the marketing service API, so developers can connect email to your company's workflow.
