Email harvesting is the process of obtaining lists, either by purchase or theft, of valid email addresses for the purpose of sending bulk email or spam, or in malicious instances, phishing attempts.

Spammers may use bots to find valid email addresses on the Internet by spidering web pages. The CAN-SPAM Act of 2003 made it illegal to harvest email addresses via these automated means, and to sell or give away lists of recipients gathered for legitimate purposes.

The email addresses of your customers are valuable, so SendGrid takes the security of your send lists very seriously.
