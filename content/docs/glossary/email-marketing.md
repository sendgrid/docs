Email Marketing (also known as commercial or promotional email) as defined by the CAN-SPAM Act is any message in which the primary purpose “advertises or promotes a commercial product or service, including content on a website operated for a commercial purpose.” Examples of email marketing include:

* Coupons

Email marketing attempts to encourage the recipient to take an action like making a purchase, downloading content, registering for a service, attending an event, or visiting a store.
