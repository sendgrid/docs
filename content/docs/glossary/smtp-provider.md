An email SMTP provider is an email delivery vendor that uses Simple Mail Transfer Protocol ([SMTP]({{root_url}}/glossary/smtp/)) to send and receive email messages. Email messages traverse SMTP to relay your messages from your server to the recipient’s server so that it can be delivered and read by the end recipient.

While some companies choose to set up and monitor their own SMTP server to send their email to subscribers, many are opting for a reliable SMTP provider to handle their email for them. An SMTP provider is a third party [email service provider](https://sendgrid.com) that will send (and ideally, deliver) your email on your behalf. This is particularly beneficial for senders who are sending large volumes of email to ensure proper handling, delivering, and monitoring of their marketing and transactional email streams.

Using an SMTP provider has many benefits. Usually, SMTP providers, like SendGrid, are experts in the field of email delivery and will take proactive steps to ensure that email sent through their system follows the email best practices preferred by the ISPs and gets delivered. Secondly, an SMTP provider can bypass certain limits placed on individual senders, such as rate limits per hour or even volume limits, which can impact the success of your campaign. Lastly, the proper affiliation with an SMTP provider can reduce the probability that your emails will be [labeled as SPAM](https://sendgrid.com/blog/email-sending-spam-now/). An SMTP provider can also mediate with the ISPs and alert you to ongoing changes in the email landscape.

Most importantly, an SMTP provider will deliver the right tools to help prevent, diagnose, and fix email delivery failures by allowing you to monitor what is going on with your email program. Email statistics such as delivery rates, response rates, and spam complaints can help you optimize your email campaigns for maximum email delivery and response. Plus, access to [email deliverability]({{root_url}}/glossary/deliverability/) experts through an SMTP provider can help supplement your team without taxing your internal resources or maintaining your own servers.
