An invalid email occurs when you attempt to send email to an address that is formatted in a manner that does not meet internet email format standards. Examples include addresses without the “@” sign or addresses that include certain special characters and/or spaces. This response comes from our own server since an invalid email is impossible to even attempt to send to its [non-existent] destination.
