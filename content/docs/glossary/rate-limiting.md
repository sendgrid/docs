There are limitations to delivery rates imposed by recipient mail servers. Exceeding these limitations results in a practice
referred to as [throttling]({{root_url}}/glossary/throttling/). Throttling in terms of email means that a recipient mail server has accepted all the mail it is
willing to accept from your IP for a certain period of time.

Please visit our [pricing page]({{site.pricing_url}}?mc=SendGrid%20Documentation) to see the account specific sending limits.
