A drip campaign is a type of automated [email marketing strategy]({{root_url}}/glossary/email-marketing/) that involves sending a recipient
a series of pre-written messages according to a predetermined schedule. This schedule is often
initiated by certain events in the recipient’s lifecycle as a customer, such as registering for
a service or purchasing a product. Drip campaigns revolve around the idea of slowly “dripping”
specific emails to a recipient in an effort to generate or increase customer engagement over a finite
period of time.

Drip campaigns help you to send relevant and well timed emails that your customers are likely interested in
seeing. Striving to send emails that are relevant to your recipients can help to improve your [sender
reputation](https://sendgrid.com/blog/what-is-a-domain-reputation/), cultivate customer satisfaction, and increase customer retention.

It is important to avoid initiating a series of messages that your customer doesn’t want to receive. Make sure
that you give your recipient the option of opting out of the drip campaign by including an [unsubscribe link]({{root_url}}/ui/sending-email/group-unsubscribes/) in
every email you send.
