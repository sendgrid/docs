An autoresponder is a computer program that generates a response to an email, request, or action. Autoresponders were initially used to notify a sender of an undeliverable email, but now they are often used in email marketing. Autoresponders can give you the ability to send a customer a pre-written email when a specified event takes place, such as a customer creating an account or purchasing a product.

- Autoresponders can be outsourced to an **Application Service Provider** that provides the infrastructure and support for the autoresponder.

- Autoresponders can also be **installed server-side**, giving you complete control while requiring you to provide the infrastructure and technical skill to maintain the autoresponder.

You can set up an autoresponder with SendGrid, by utilizing the [Inbound Parse Webhook]({{root_url}}/for-developers/parsing-email/setting-up-the-inbound-parse-webhook/) and the [v3 Mail Send endpoint]({{root_url}}/API_Reference/Web_API_v3/Mail/index.html).
