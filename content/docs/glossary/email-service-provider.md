An Email Service Provider (ESP) is a service organization that provides transactional and/or marketing email services.

Most ESPs include features that allow customers to:

* Upload and maintain subscriber lists
* Schedule and send marketing campaigns
* Manage transactional email
* Improve email deliverability
* Monitor statistics of your email campaigns

ESPs like SendGrid also provide expertise on increasing your [email deliverability]({{root_url}}/glossary/email-deliverability/), preserving your sending reputation. They may utilize features and tools to accomplish this, such as:

* [IP Whitelabeling]({{root_url}}/glossary/reverse-dns/)
* [Dedicated IPs]({{root_url}}/API_Reference/Web_API_v3/IP_Management/index/)
* [IP warming]({{root_url}}/help-support/sending-email/warming-up-an-ip-address/)

An ESP may provide email services via a user interface (UI), or may also be an [SMTP provider]({{root_url}}/glossary/smtp-provider/). SendGrid provides both services.
