A domain is a named Internet address that resolves to the numbered Internet Protocol (IP) addresses computers use to connect. Examples: sendgrid.com, yourdomain.com, google.com. Simply put, it’s the web address your users type into their browser to learn about your company.

If you are on a Pro 100k or above plan you will have your very own dedicated IP address which we encourage you to [set up reverse DNS]({{root_url}}/help-support/sending-email/how-to-set-up-reverse-dns.html)

## 	SMTP Domain
 	An example of one of the SendGrid domains is our SMTP domain: `smtp.sendgrid.com`
