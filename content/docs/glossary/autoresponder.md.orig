An autoresponder is a computer program that generates a response to an email, request, or action. Autoresponders were initially used to notify a sender of an undeliverable email, but now they are often used in email marketing. Autoresponders can give you the ability to send a customer a pre-written email when a specified event takes place, such as a customer creating an account or purchasing a product.

- Autoresponders can be outsourced to an **Application Service Provider** that provides the infrastructure and support for the autoresponder.

- Autoresponders can also be **installed server-side**, giving you complete control while requiring you to provide the infrastructure and technical skill to maintain the autoresponder.
