Sends relate to your requests to deliver email to your recipients through SendGrid's API or UI. We process the requests to send the email from you to your contacts and may encounter events such as deferred, delivered, blocked and bounced when we attempt to deliver your email to the corresponding email service providers and email exchange servers. Once the recipient receives the email and interacts with it, more events will be captured such as clicks, opens, unsubscribes, spam reports, etc. We keep track of email events in the [Email Activity]({{root_url}}/ui/analytics-and-reporting/email-activity/) and aggregate data in [Statistics]({{root_url}}/ui/analytics-and-reporting/stats-overview/) .
