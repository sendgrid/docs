Transactional email is relationship content that “facilitates an already agreed-upon transaction or updates a customer about an ongoing transaction.” It includes any email triggered by a user’s interaction with a web application, such as:

* Account Signups
* Password changes
* Purchase Receipts
* Check-ins
* Notifications
* Friend/follower requests

These emails typically contain information a user wants or needs and consequently have the highest open rates across all categories of email.

Because transactional email is so desired, you want to make sure that it consistently reaches your customers’ inboxes. In order to ensure strong email deliverability, rely on a trusted cloud-email service like SendGrid.
