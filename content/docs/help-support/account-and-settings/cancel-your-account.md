  description: Steps for canceling your SendGrid account using the SendGrid UI


---

We’re sorry to see anyone leave, but things happen and we totally understand.

*To cancel your SendGrid account:*

1. Log into the SendGrid UI.
1. Select **Settings** and then click **Plan & Billing Details**.
1. At the bottom of the page, click **Cancel Account**.

<call-out>

Cancellations take full effect on the first day of the next calendar month, at which point your account will still be usable, but will be at the Free package level.
