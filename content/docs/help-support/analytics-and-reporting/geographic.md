The geographical report shows a map of where your emails are being opened and clicked around the world. It is based purely on where your users live. For example you don’t have any recipients engaging with your emails France, you will not see stats for France in your stats.

## 	Top 5
 	
The top 5 section will show you the most engaged geographical areas based on the selected metric. By default, clicks are select, but you can change that by choosing a metric from the button at the top of this section. You can change which metrics, date, or grouping by adjusting the [statistics filters]({{root_url}}/help-support/analytics-and-reporting/stats-overview/#-Statistics-Filters).

## 	Activity Map
 	
The activity map gives you a visualization of your metric based statistics on an actual map. From the world view, you can click a country to see more specific geographic locations.

## 	Figures by Location
 	
The figures table gives you all of the specific counts or percentages of each event, according to how you’ve grouped your stats (day, week, or month). For example, if you wanted to see what percentage of the emails you sent were actually opened on the second week of April in California, this is a great place to check.

This table will refresh with new or adjusted data based on the various filters available at the top of the page. You can also choose to show actual counts or percentages, by clicking the corresponding button above and to the right of the table.

To see only the figures from a specific geographic area, change the Activity Map to be either the world view or a specific country, then select the countries or states you want to see in the figures table using the buttons just above and to the right of the figures data.
