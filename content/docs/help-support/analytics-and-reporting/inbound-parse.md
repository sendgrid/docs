The Inbound Parse Webhook accepts emails on behalf of your specified hostname, parses them, and sends the headers, contents, and attachments to a URL you select. We provide you with statistics about how many emails SendGrid is parsing for you over time. You can control the graph by adjusting the [statistics filters]({{root_url}}/help-support/analytics-and-reporting/stats-overview.html#-Statistics-Filters).
