On all other stats pages, your subuser stats are “rolled up” into the parent account’s statistics. From this page, you can see how each subuser affects your overall stats.

Subusers can help organize your email sending an analytics by enabling you to segment by a different sender and IP address. As a result, you may want to compare one subuser to another. The category comparison tool allows you to do this. You can change which metrics, date, or grouping by adjusting the [statistics filters]({{root_url}}/help-support/analytics-and-reporting/stats-overview/#-Statistics-Filters).

## 	Select Your Subusers
 	
You can compare up to 10 subusers at a time. To select them, click the “+” sign next to each subuser name in the left-side list. Then, click the “Compare” button.

## 	Comparison Overview
 	
Once you have selected the subusers, your top most graph will show you how each selected subuser has fared for each individual metric in a single graph. Each subuser will be assigned a color in this bar chart.

You can remove individual subusers from the list of subusers you selected initially, by clicking the “Subusers” button and unchecking subusers. The graph will refresh, showing only the selected subusers.

## 	Individual Metrics Comparison
 	
When you initially choose the subusers to compare, this graph will be titled “Comparison for Deliveries” and will show you the delivery rates over time for each of the compared subusers.

You can remove individual subusers from the list of categories you selected initially, by clicking the “Subusers” button and unchecking subusers. The graph will refresh, showing only the selected subusers.

To change this graph to see another metric for your subusers, click the button next to the “Subusers” button and choose another metric.

## 	Individual Metrics Figures
 	
When you initially choose the subusers to compare, this table will be titled “Figures for Delivered” and will show you the actual delivery numbers over time for each of the compared subusers.

You can remove individual subusers from the list of categories you selected initially, by clicking the “Subusers” button and unchecking subusers. The graph will refresh, showing only the selected subusers.

To change this graph to see another metric, click the button inline with the graph title and choose another metric.

You can also choose to show actual counts or percentages, by clicking the corresponding button above and to the right of the table.
