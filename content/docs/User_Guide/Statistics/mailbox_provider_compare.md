Mailbox provider information can help optimize your email sending by showing you how different mailbox providers affect how your recipients interact with your email. As a result, you may want to compare one mailbox provider to another to see differences or to see if a recent change has made an improvement. The mailbox provider comparison tool allows you to do this. You can change which metrics, date, or grouping by adjusting the [statistics filters]({{root_url}}/User_Guide/Statistics/index.html#-Statistics-Filters).
