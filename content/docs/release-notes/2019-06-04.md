### Removal of Legacy Email Activity API - Free Plans

In order to continue to optimize the efficiency of our infrastructure we are removing access to the undocumented legacy email activity API for Free plans. We recommend using the [event webhook]({{root_url}}/for-developers/tracking-events/getting-started-event-webhook/) to absorb your email event data or visit the [enhanced email activity feed]({{root_url}}/ui/analytics-and-reporting/email-activity-feed/) in the UI to pinpoint specific email messages with its sequential event data. If you are interested in the ability to search and download a CSV with 30 days of email event activity programmatically, you could consider upgrading to an essentials account and purchasing additional history with access to the [new email activity API](https://sendgrid.api-docs.io/v3.0/email-activity/filter-all-messages).
