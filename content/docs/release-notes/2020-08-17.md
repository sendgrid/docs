### Create segments based on “Date Added” and “Last Updated” of a Contact

You can now create new segments based on two additional date criteria: when a contact was added to Marketing Campaigns and the last time a contact was updated. The criteria are listed as "Date Added" and "Last Updated" in Marketing Campaigns. For more information about segments, see [Segmenting your Contacts]({{root_url}}/ui/managing-contacts/segmenting-your-contacts/)
