### Email Validation API in Open Beta

Our real-time [Email Validation API](https://sendgrid-email-validation.api-docs.io/v3/getting-started/authentication) helps protect your sending reputation by validating email addresses before you send to them. Use detailed results from our machine learning-powered, mailbox provider-friendly API to alert subscribers of possible typos while they’re still in the signup form and protect your sending reputation by decreasing the risk of your email bouncing. Currently available for free while in Beta to Pro and Premier Email API plans. Learn more about [this announcement](https://sendgrid.com/blog/sendgrid-email-validation-api/), [how to use it](https://sendgrid.com/docs/ui/managing-contacts/email-address-validation/), and the [future pricing](http://sendgrid.com/solutions/email-validation-api/).
