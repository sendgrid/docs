###	Substitution tag update

Substitution tags are no longer case sensitive in the email content. Previously, the substitution tag in your email content had to exactly match the substitution tag. For example, if you have the substitution tag <code>[%panda%]</code>, and your email content says <code>"hello [%PANda%], buy my bamboo"</code>, the substitution tag for <code>[%panda%]</code> is now applied.
