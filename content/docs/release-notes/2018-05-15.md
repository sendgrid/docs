###	Send To and Export All Contacts

We've updated Marketing Campaigns to allow you to send to and export all contacts within your database. Your 'All Contacts' database now operates like other lists that you create. To send to all contacts, select "All Contacts" from the recipients dropdown when editing a campaign. To export all contacts, select "Export" from the action menu on the <a href="https://sendgrid.com/marketing_campaigns/ui/contacts" target="_blank">Contacts page</a> or by clicking the "Export CSV" button, now located in the top-right when viewing <a href="https://sendgrid.com/marketing_campaigns/ui/all_contacts" target="_blank">All Contacts</a>.
