###	Truncating fields that go over max field character limits

This change applies to contacts added by uploading a CSV in the UI or when using the <code>POST /contactdb/lists/{list_id}/recipients/{recipient_id}</code> Add a Single Recipient to a List method. When adding or updating the <code>first_name</code> and <code>last_name</code> fields, SendGrid automatically truncates any field that exceeds the maximum character limit to ensure that the field is valid. Non-unicode characters are still not valid.
