### New Marketing Campaigns

A brand new version of Marketing Campaigns, with the addition of [Automation]({{root_url}}/ui/sending-email/getting-started-with-automation/), [Email Testing]({{root_url}}/ui/sending-email/email-testing/), and [Signup Forms]({{root_url}}/ui/managing-contacts/create-and-manage-contacts/#create-a-signup-form) is now generally available. These new features are incremental to the existing functionality for [one-to-many campaign sending]({{root_url}}/ui/sending-email/how-to-send-email-with-marketing-campaigns/#creating-a-single-send), [contact management]({{root_url}}/ui/managing-contacts/create-and-manage-contacts/#manage-contacts), real-time analytics, and more.
