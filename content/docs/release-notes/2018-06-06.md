###	TLS security

SendGrid now uses Transport Layer Security (TLS) protocol v1.1 to send encrypted mail. If you have the Enforce TLS feature activated on one of your SendGrid accounts, messages sent to inbox providers that can only accept TLS v1.0 trigger a “TLS required but not supported” drop event. Based on our testing, most inbox providers support TLS versions v1.1 and above.
