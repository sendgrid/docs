### Removal of Legacy Email Activity API - Essential Plans

In order to continue to optimize the efficiency of our infrastructure, we are removing access to the undocumented legacy email activity API for Essential plans. We recommend using the [event webhook]({{root_url}}/for-developers/tracking-events/getting-started-event-webhook/) to absorb your email event data or visit the [enhanced email activity feed]({{root_url}}/ui/analytics-and-reporting/email-activity-feed/) in the UI to pinpoint specific email messages with its sequential event data. If you are interested in the ability to search and download a CSV with 30 days of email event activity programmatically, you should consider purchasing additional history with access to the [new email activity API](https://sendgrid.api-docs.io/v3.0/email-activity/filter-all-messages).
