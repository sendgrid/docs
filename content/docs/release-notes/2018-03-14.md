###	Fixed a segmentation date issue

There was a bug in the UI that affected the way that dates displayed for events when creating a segment. Specifically, the UI would show "01/01/70" as dates for events, when there was no data present. This has been resolved and now aligns with the rest of the UI, displaying "-" when applicable.
