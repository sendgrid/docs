The Email Activity feed allows you to view a snapshot of email-related activity associated with your account and any subusers. Enhanced email activity and storage gives you increased visibility into the email delivery flow of each email message to expedite the troubleshooting process.

With the Email Activity feed you can:

* Troubleshoot email delivery issues faster with comprehensive and sequential event data by email message.
* Pinpoint specific emails easily with advanced search and filter options --including subject line and email metadata.
* Customize your data independently with CSV download/export option.
* Increase storage available for up to 30 days for historical visibility within the UI by purchasing an upgrade.
* Call all events by an email from the API with additional storage purchase.

<call-out>

In order to gain access to the Email Activity Feed API, you must purchase [additional email activity history](https://app.sendgrid.com/settings/billing/addons/email_activity).

## 	Types of email activity data

The Email Activity feed allows you to view specific information about messages sent from your account.

<table class="table" style="table-layout:fixed">
  <tr>
  <th  >Event</th>
    <th  >Description</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
    <td>Processed</td>
    <td>Requests from your website, application, or mail client via SMTP Relay or the API that SendGrid processed.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Clicks</td>
    <td>Whenever a recipient clicks one of the Click Tracked links in your email. In the Email History SendGrid displays the date, time, and the URL for the link that was clicked.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Delivered</td>
    <td>The accepted response generated by the recipients' mail server.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Opens</td>
    <td>The response generated by a recipient opening an email.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Unsubscribes</td>
    <td>Whenever a recipient unsubscribes from your emails. </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Group Unsubscribes</td>
    <td>Whenever a recipient unsubscribes from a suppression group.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Group Resubscribes</td>
    <td>When a recipient resubscribes themselves to a suppression group.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Deferred</td>
    <td>The recipient mail server asked SendGrid to stop sending emails so fast.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Drops</td>
    <td>SendGrid will drop an email when the contact on that email is in one of your suppression groups, the recipient email previously bounced, or that recipient has marked your email as spam.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Bounces </td>
    <td>The receiving server could not or would not accept the message. If a recipient has previously unsubscribed from your emails, your attempt to send to them is bounced.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Blocks</td>
    <td>When your IP address has been blacklisted or blocked by an ISP or messaging organization. Blocks are less severe than bounces and do not result in permanent suppressions: subsequent sends to blocked email addresses are not automatically suppressed.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Spam Reports</td>
    <td>Whenever a recipient marks your email as spam and their mail server tells us about it.</td>
  </tr>

## 	Basic search

The email address field filters with an approximate, or fuzzy search. The date field pulls filters events that fit within the precise date range specified.
