Mailbox provider information can help optimize your email sending by showing you how different mailbox providers affect how your recipients interact with your email. As a result, you may want to compare one mailbox provider to another to see differences or to see if a recent change has made an improvement. The mailbox provider comparison tool allows you to do this. You can change which metrics, date, or grouping by adjusting the [statistics filters]({{root_url}}/knowledge-center/analytics-and-reporting/stats-overview/#statistics-filters).

## 	Comparison Overview

Your top most graph will show you how each selected mailbox provider has fared for the selected individual metric in the donut graph (mmm donuts).

## 	Individual Metrics Comparison

This graph will show you the mailbox provider stats for the selected metric. To change the metric, select it from the button at the top of the page.

You can remove individual providers from the graph by clicking the button above and to the right of this chart and unchecking the boxes next to the provider name. The graph will refresh, showing only the stats for the selected mailbox providers.

## 	Individual Metrics Figures

This table will be titled “Figures for Delivered” and will show you the actual delivery numbers over time for each of the compared providers.

You can also choose to show actual counts or percentages, by clicking the corresponding button above and to the right of the table.
