# SendGrid Documentation

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/sendgrid/docs.svg?branch=develop)](https://travis-ci.org/sendgrid/docs)
[![Dependency Status](https://gemnasium.com/sendgrid/docs.svg)](https://gemnasium.com/sendgrid/docs)

This site is based on Octopress, which is in turn based on Jekyll, with a dash of Twitter Bootstrap added.

The develop branch is continuously deployed to a preview site. [View dev site](http://d2w67tjf43xwdp.cloudfront.net/)

The master branch is continuously deployed to production.

_Please_, feel free to make any contributions you feel will make SendGrid Documentation better.

**Submit all pull requests to the develop branch**

**Before your pull request can be merged into the develop branch, you must submit a completed CLA.**

## CLAs and CCLAs

Before you get started, SendGrid requires that a SendGrid Contributor License Agreement (CLA) be filled out by every contributor to a SendGrid open source project.

Our goal with the CLA is to clarify the rights of our contributors and reduce other risks arising from inappropriate contributions.  The CLA also clarifies the rights SendGrid holds in each contribution and helps to avoid misunderstandings over what rights each contributor is required to grant to SendGrid when making a contribution.  In this way the CLA encourages broad participation by our open source community and helps us build strong open source projects, free from any individual contributor withholding or revoking rights to any contribution.

SendGrid does not merge a pull request made against a SendGrid open source project until that pull request is associated with a signed CLA. Copies of the CLA are available [here](https://gist.github.com/SendGridDX/98b42c0a5d500058357b80278fde3be8#file-sendgrid_cla).

When you create a Pull Request, after a few seconds, a comment will appear with a link to the CLA. Click the link and fill out the brief form and then click the "I agree" button and you are all set. You will not be asked to re-sign the CLA unless we make a change.

## Local Setup

* Clone the repo.
* `npm install` to install build tools.
* `bower install` to install client-side dependencies (jQuery,
  bootstrap)
* `bundle install` to install required rubygems.
* Copy `_config.sample.yml` and name it `_config.yml`
* Set your root (if you're running locally it'll just be `/`) in `_config.yml`
* `bundle exec rake preview`
* Browse to `localhost:4000`

## Vagrant Setup

* Clone the repo.
* Bring up development environment with Vagrant

		$ vagrant up

* Browse to [http://localhost:4000](http://localhost:4000)

## Testing

		$ vagrant ssh
		$ cd docs && bin/test

## Important Things to Know

* The source files are in `/source`, and the generated files will be created in `/public`. They get overwritten or wiped out when the site is rebuilt.

* To rebuild the site: <code>rake generate</code>

## Config

The config is defined in `_config.yml`.

The only config variables you should need to know about are <code>root</code>, which is the root from which all links are calculated, and the <code>folder_weights</code> hash, which specifies the order that the folders should be displayed in the nav tree. Higher weights mean higher display priority (higher in the tree). You can also specify icons for folders with the
<code>folder_icons</code> hash.

There's also a <code>version</code> number in the config.

### The Nav Tree

The nav tree is generated by the plugin `site_navigation.rb`. It is essentially a recursive traversal of all the folders and pages in the Source folder that generates a hierarchical tree, sorted by folder weight and page weight.

Breadcrumbs are generated by the `breadcrumbs.rb` plugin.

### Pages

You can write pages in markdown, HTML, or HAML. They all get converted to HTML when the site is generated.

Pages have a block of YAML at the top that sets a few options. They are pretty self-explanatory; here's an example

```
---
layout: page
weight: 0
title: Docs Home
icon: icon-home
showTitle: false
navigation:
  show: true
---
```

Weights are same as the folder weights - the higher numbers move higher up the tree. Icons are based on the CSS icon class names from Twitter Bootstrap. showTitle and navigation["show"] both default to true if not specified.

#### SEO
Various fields pertinent to SEO can be controlled through the YAML frontmatter. Here's an example:

```
---
seo:
  title: Really Great Documentation - SendGrid Documentation | SendGrid
  override: true
  description: This is some really great documentation! I hope you like it!
  canonical: http://sendgrid.com/docs/really-great-docs
---
```

By default `<title>` tags follow the template `{Page Title} {Site Title}`. However the page title can be changed for the purpose of the tag by using `seo["title"]`. `seo["override"]` will override the entire template, instead making the title page `{seo["title"]}`. `description` and `canonical` change their respective tags.

### Custom Liquid Tags
There are some custom plugins (look in the `plugins` folder) that define new liquid blocks for use in pages.

#### Anchors

You can create anchor tags that will have named anchors generated for them automatically with links on hover.
The parameter is the wrapping element to use.

```
{% anchor h2 %}
Some Anchor Text
{% endanchor %}
```
#### Info blocks

Similarly you can create info and warning blocks:

```
{% info %}
Some info for a breakout block.
{% endinfo %}

{% warning %}
...And a warning breakout.
{% endwarning %}
```

#### API Examples

If you are working on API reference docs, you can generate XML and JSON nav tabs and the corresponding example calls and responses like so:

```
{% apiexample identifier GET http://some.endpoint.url var1=stuff&var2=junk %}
  {% response json %}
{ "foo": "bar" }
  {% endresponse %}

  {% response xml %}
<foo>bar</foo>
  {% endresponse %}
{% endapiexample %}
```

The parameters for the `apiexample` block are: unique identifier, HTTP
method, the url (excluding .json or .xml extension), and the data
payload in querystring format.

## JS and CSS, etc

JavaScript and CSS are minified and combined. The files to be packaged and their orders are specified in `_includes/head.html` and <code>CssMinify.yml</code>. Preprocessing and options can be specified
via `_plugins/jekyll_asset_pipeline.rb`.
