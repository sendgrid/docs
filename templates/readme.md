# Docs templates

These templates exist for people who want to add new documentation pages to the [SendGrid docs](https://github.com/sendgrid/docs), or people who want to update existing content to our new jobs-to-be-done format.

Currently, we have templates for:
- [Partner documentation](#-Adding-partner-documentation)

## Adding partner documentation

Use these instructions if you are a SendGrid partner, or you use a SendGrid partner, and you want to add documentation to support the partner integration.

*To add a new partner page:*

1. Click ![]({{root_url}}/images/github_create_new_file.png "Create a new file") in [Source>Integrate>Tutorials](source/Integrate/Tutorials).
1. Copy the content of the [Partners Template](https://github.com/sendgrid/docs/tree/develop/templates/partners.md) to your new file.
1. Customize the content for your integration.
1. When you're ready to submit the content to SendGrid for review, follow the prompts to commit the new content, and then create a pull request against the develop branch. Make sure to [sign the SendGrid CLA](https://cla.sendgrid.com/sendgrid/docs).

Once you've submitted a pull request, someone on the SendGrid docs team will review it! We may have some questions or requests for more information, so please check back.
