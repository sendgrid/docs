If you want to receive a SendGrid email every time you receive a new Event Webhook post, you can do that using [Zapier](http://zapier.com).

You will need:

* a [SendGrid](http://sendgrid.com) account
* a [Zapier](http://zapier.com) account

## Steps

1. [Getting your accounts ready](#ready)
2. [Connecting your accounts](#connect)

### Getting your accounts ready<a name="ready"></a>


To establish a Webhook on Zapier, you will need only your Zapier account. Zapier will set up a custom Webhook url, for information on how to get started using these Webhooks, check [here](https://zapier.com/help/webhooks/#how-get-started-webhooks-zapier).

To link your Webhooks on Zapier to SendGrid, you must have an active SendGrid account. To learn more about getting started with SendGrid basics, start [here](https://sendgrid.com/docs/index.html). For more information about getting started with SendGrid on Zapier, go [here](https://zapier.com/help/sendgrid/#how-get-started-sendgrid).

### Connecting your accounts<a name="connect"></a>

Click here to [Send emails through SendGrid for new caught Webhook data](https://zapier.com/zapbook/zaps/4784/send-emails-through-sendgrid-for-new-caught-webhook-data/).

1. Zapier will automatically generate a Webhook for you to send requests to. When you have this, click **Ok, continue**.
2. Choose whether or not you wish to specify a **Child Key** for your Webhook. Click **Save + Continue**.
3. Choose your SendGrid account from the list of accounts, or connect a new account.
4. To connect your SendGrid account to Zapier for the first time, you will enter the credentials of an API/mail account. If you have not created this account, you can do so [here](https://sendgrid.com/credentials).

5. Using fields from the Webhook, create and customize the **To**, **From**, and **Subject** email message that the Zap will send.

6. Click **Save + Finish**.

Now test the Zap to make sure it works. Once you’re satisfied with the results, new Webhook payloads will automatically cause a corresponding SendGrid email to be sent.

*Note: if you ever want to change this Zapier and SendGrid integration, just go to [your Zapier dashboard](https://zapier.com/app/dashboard) and tweak anything you'd like.*
