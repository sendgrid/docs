### Configuring the EventKit App

The EventKit Rails is an open source app that our Support Incubator team built. This app allows you to easily setup our Event API on your server and provides a easy to use reporting system. Ron goes into detail on how to setup the [EventKit](https://github.com/sendgrid/eventkit-rails) on your [free Heroku account](https://www.heroku.com/pricing), and demonstrates its basic and useful functionality.
