Legacy Newsletter
{% endanchor %}

Legacy Newsletter has been sunset and can no longer be used to build or send campaigns. In order to continue sending marketing emails, SendGrid recommends switching to [Marketing Campaigns](https://sendgrid.com/docs/User_Guide/Marketing_Campaigns/index.html). See the [documentation](https://sendgrid.com/docs/User_Guide/Legacy_Newsletter/index.html) for more information on why we made the switch.
