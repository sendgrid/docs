Browser information can help optimize your email sending by showing you how different browser usage affects how your recipients interact with your email. As a result, you may want to compare one browser’s stats to another to see differences or to see if a recent change has made an improvement. The browser comparison tool allows you to do this. You can change which metrics, date, or grouping by adjusting the [statistics filters]({{root_url}}/Help/Analytics_and_Reporting/Statistics/index.html#-Statistics-Filters).
