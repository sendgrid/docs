if you're attempting to change the password for your SendGrid account and you're integrated via AppDirect the instructions to do so are slightly different. Rather than updating them via the **Account Settings**  you can update your credentials by going to **Manage Apps** > **SendGrid** > **Settings**  via the AppDirect UI.
