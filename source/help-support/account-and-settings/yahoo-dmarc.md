Yahoo mail domains have battened down the hatches, so to speak, and are starting to embrace [DMARC](http://sendgrid.com/blog/dmarc-domain-based-message-authentication-reporting-conformance/) more explicitly. You may have seen an increase in bounce messages with the following explanation:

**"554 5.7.9 Message not accepted for policy reasons. See http://postmaster.yahoo.com/errors/postmaster-28.html"  **

This is because Yahoo no longer accepts messages where the From domain is a Yahoo mail domain, and the message originates from a non-approved Yahoo mail domain server/service. This is a security measure they have implemented to help reduce potential address spoofing of their mail domains. 

 

**What this means:** You can no longer send with the From address set as anything from a Yahoo address when sending to a domain that checks DMARC before accepting mail. 

**What you can do:** You will need to change the From address to a non-Yahoo address. We recommend using your own mail domain, or one you control that is legitimate. You can then set the Reply-To field to be the original Yahoo address that previously was used in the From field. 

**What about these messages, are they lost?** : Yes, any send with this bounce message is discarded and tracked as a [Block]({{site.app_url}}/suppressions/blocks). You will need to adjust your From address field settings, and then try resending from your side.

Yahoo has updated their DMARC policy to utilize **p=reject** for the below low-volume Yahoo international domains. Please make any changes you need to handle these domains in the same way you handle yahoo.com.
