{% info %}
This app is our new [Template Engine]({{root_url}}/API_Reference/Web_API_v3/Template_Engine/index.html), that supports multiple templates, versioning and more. Previously, we had a Template App, now called the [Legacy Template App]({{root_url}}/Apps/email_templates.html). 
{% endinfo %}

This app seperates email templates and design from sending, allowing templates to be worked on through the SendGrid UI and then populated during mail sending.

{% info %}
There is currently a limit of 100 Templates and 100 Versions that may be created per account. _Please reach out to support if you reach into the limit._
{% endinfo %}

This app is differs from our other apps, and may be found in a [different location](https://sendgrid.com/templates).

More documentation may be found with the [Template Engine API Reference]({{root_url}}/API_Reference/Web_API_v3/Template_Engine/index.html).
