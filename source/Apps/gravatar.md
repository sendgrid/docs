This app inserts an <img> tag at the bottom of the HTML section of an e-mail to display the Gravatar associated with the e-mail sender. Gravatar (an abbreviation for globally recognized avatar) is a service for providing globally-unique avatars preselected by the user in question which are available to any application set to look for such avatars across the web.
