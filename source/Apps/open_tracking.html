<p>The Open Tracking app adds an invisible image at the end of the email which can track e-mail opens. If the email recipient has images enabled on the email client, a request to server for the invisible image is executed and an open event is logged. These Events are logged in your <a href="{{root_url}}/Delivery_Metrics/">Statistics</a> portal, the <a href="{{root_url}}/Delivery_Metrics/email_activity.html">Email Activity</a> interface, and are reported by the <a href="{{root_url}}/API_Reference/Webhooks/event.html">Event Webhook</a>.</p>

<p><img src="{{root_url}}/images/open_tracking.png" alt="" title="open-fixed"></p>

<p>When using this service customers often ask the difference between a unique open versus an open.  A unique open is logged only the first time a given recipient opens the email whereas normal opens are logged for all opens of the email in question. </p>

{% info %}
As open tracking adds an "invisible" image at the end of emails, it is recommended that your email includes a visible image, as it can be confusing to users when their mail client asks them to load images, and apparently none load.
