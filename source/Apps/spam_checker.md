The Spam Checker app,is useful when your web application allows your end users to create content that is then emailed through your SendGrid account. Since emailing user generated content is hard to monitor and can often be abused by spammers, the Spam Checker filter can provide notification when emails are detected that exceed a predefined spam threshold.

![Spam Checker App Image]({{root_url}}/images/spam_checker.png "Spam Checker")

We use SpamAssassin to process the spam checks for this filter. The default threshold is 5.0, but you can set this to any value between 1 and 10. If you provide a URL, we will post the message to that URL, but this field is optional. If a message is flagged as spam using this filter, it will automatically be dropped by our system and will not be delivered to the recipient. 
{% warning %}
The Default Value for this App is 5, and can be ranged between 1 and 10. The lower the number, the more strict the filtering. For example, a value of 2 will drop all but the most flawless of emails, where as 9 will only drop the spammiest of spam emails.

         <td>No (default:5)</td>
         <td>Emails with a spam score over this value will be considered spam and will not be delivered to the recipient. We use SpamAssassin to process the spam checks for this App, so you can base your Spam Threshold setting on values typically used with SpamAssassin. The more negative a score is, the less likely it is to be spam, conversely increasing positive numbers suggest a message is spam.</td>

The HTTP POST request that you receive at the designated URL will contain parameters with details about the spam checker event. If the URL is not specified, this HTTP POST request will simply not occur.
