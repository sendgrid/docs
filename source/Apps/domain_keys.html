<p>Some ISPs (most notably Yahoo!) authenticate e-mail using Domain Keys. Domain Keys work by having a company sign an e-mail with their private key, and then publish a public key in their DNS, which is then used to verify the e-mail signature.</p>

<p>The domain that is checked for the public key is based on one of two e-mail headers; Sender and From.
If a Sender header is specified, its domain will be the first one checked, otherwise the domain of the From header will be used. Most e-mail clients do not insert a Sender header, so typically the From address would be used.</p>

<p>By default, SendGrid signs all e-mail with Domain Keys to improve its deliverability, however for accounts that do not have Whitelabeling enabled the domain in the From field will not have the proper DNS record to authenticate the e-mail. Because of this SendGrid inserts a Sender header and the e-mail can then be properly authenticated.

</table><p>Some ISPs or e-mail clients (such as Hotmail or Outlook) will display a message with the Sender header reading "on behalf of" followed by the address that is in the Sender header. To remove this, do one of the following:</p>

<p>1.Disable the Domain Keys filter in the filters section of your account</p>
<p>2.Upgrade to a package (Silver or higher) that provides <a href="http://sendgrid.com/whitelabel/">Whitelabel</a> support and set up the Domain Keys record in your DNS</p>
