So, you've got a CSV, Excel Spreadsheet, or other list of your users that you'd like to send your newsletter to, but you're not sure how to get that into our web-based Newsletter App? Here you go!


## Step 1: "Create New" Email List


Once you're logged in, you go to the "Apps" tab, then select "My Newsletters" from the list on the right hand side of the page. That brings you to the Newsletter Dashboard. You then select "Create New" under the Recipient List:

## Step 2: Name your new List


Name your list something definitive. Is this your list of blog followers, or only the people who've purchased exclusive content Maybe it's all the clients who attended your seminar last week, and you want to let them know about the next series. "Blog Readers", "eBook Purchaser", "May 12 Seminar Attendees", you get the idea.


## Step 3: Upload CSV


If it's not already selected, select the "Upload List" radio button, then click the "Upload CSV" button. Once the file is uploaded, you may need to drag & drop the "Name" and "Email" cells to make sure they are over the appropriate columns. The column headers are not required in the CSV file. After the upload process, You will get to preview the file. There, you will fill in or drag & drop the column headers. The order of the columns doesn't matter, but there must be an email column. Once everything's lined up right, it should look something like this:

## Step 4: Review & Verify List


Here, you can make sure that all data was imported properly, delete line items that are incorrect. Once you are done here, select "Verify". That's it, you're ready to create a newsletter, and send it to that list!
