<p>Sections are an extension of <a href="/documentation/api/smtp-api/developers-guide/substitution-tags/">substitution values</a> that allow a user to specify large text blocks that will be mostly the same that can then be selected and customized on a per user basis. This is useful for sending dynamic content where a large section of the body will be similar across several users, as opposed to duplicating that text each time. </p>

<p>The format of the SMTP section key has the form:</p>

``` javascript
{ "section" : { "-sectionName1-" : "section 1 text", "sectionName2" : "section 2 text" } }
```

<p>Typical usage is to have a tag in the body of your email that references a per user substitution tag. This user tag will contain a reference to a section tag. Section text may contain references to per recipient substitution variables.</p>

<h3>Section Tag Example</h3>

Message body:
``` html
<html>
 <body>
   Hi -name-,<br>
      We thought you might be interested in this special offer. 
      -body-
 </body>
</html>
```

<p>An accompanying SMTPAPI JSON header might look something like this:</p>

```javascript
{
    "to": [
        "alice@example.com",
        "joe@example.com"
    ],
    "sub": {
        "-body-": [
            "-bodyFemale-",
            "-bodyMale-"
        ],
        "-name-": [
            "Alice",
            "Joe"
        ]
    },
    "section": {
        "-bodyFemale-": "Check out this dress -name-!",
        "-bodyMale-": "Check out this tie -name-!"
    }
}
```

The final email for Alice would look like this:
``` html
<html>
 <body>
   Hi Alice,<br>
      We thought you might be interested in this special offer. 
      Check out this dress Alice!
 </body>
</html>
