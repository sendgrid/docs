Automated email, also known as [triggered email]({{root_url}}/Glossary/triggered_email.html) or behavior-driven email, is sent when a specific [triggering event]({{root_url}}/Glossary/triggering_events.html) occurs or a specific user takes an action that prompts the delivery of the email. While traditional [marketing email]({{root_url}}/Glossary/Email_Types/index.html) involves sender-initiated promotional messages sent to a list of recipients, automated email is initiated by user behavior, allowing you to dynamically send targeted, real-time promotional content that is uniquely relevant to an individual recipient.

Examples of automated email include a welcome series [drip campaign]({{root_url}}/Glossary/drip_campaign.html) that is initiated by a new user sign-up or a win-back campaign to re-engage a lapsed user.

The ability to send very relevant, timely emails directed to individual recipients makes automated email a uniquely powerful tool for building and nurturing customer relationships, enhancing the image of your brand, and increasing customer engagement. 

You can use SendGrid’s automated, behavior driven email platform, [Threads](http://threads.io/), to track individual users and the actions that they take when interacting with your application or website. This information can then be used to dynamically create and send automated email.
