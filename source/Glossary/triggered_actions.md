Triggered actions are automatically initiated when a specific [triggering event]({{root_url}}/Glossary/triggering_events.html) that you are tracking takes place. These actions must be defined in advance, and they must be associated with a predetermined user and event.

SendGrid has partnered with [Klaviyo](https://sendgrid.com/partners/klaviyo/) to help you drive sales by using data to send triggered email, segment your lists, run better Facebook ads, and more. An example of a triggered action might be an email message (or series of messages) welcoming a new user to your website or application.
