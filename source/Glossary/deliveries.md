A delivery is recorded when a request to send an email results in the email being accepted by the receiving server, however this does not necessarily mean that the message reached the recipientâ€™s inbox. Some users and some email applications may filter the email away from the inbox even though the email was delivered to (read: accepted by) the recipient email server.

If an email is indicated as delivered you can be certain that it was not deferred by the ISP.
