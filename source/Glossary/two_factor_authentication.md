Two Factor Authentication (also known as: 2FA, two step verification, or TFA) is an extra layer of security that is known as "multi factor authentication" that requires not only a password and username but also something that only that user has on them, i.e. a piece of information only they should know or have immediately at hand such as a physical token, a phone application, or a device.

With SendGrid, you can turn this security feature on in your [Account Settings]({{root_url}}/User_Guide/Account/Account_Settings/two_factor_authentication.html). You will for security reasons, need to contact [SendGrid Support](https://support.sendgrid.com) to turn this feature off.
