A complaint is when an email recipient identifies an email message as spam or junk by clicking the “report spam” or “mark as junk” button within their email reader. 

A sender’s complaint rate is calculated by dividing the total number of emails received by the ISP by the number of complaints reported by that ISP’s customers.
