The [CAN-SPAM Act of 2003](https://www.ftc.gov/tips-advice/business-center/guidance/can-spam-act-compliance-guide-business) lists the guidelines, requirements, and potential penalties for noncompliance regarding the commercial use of email and the legal rights of recipients of commercial email. CAN-SPAM provides several requirements for commercial senders including, but not limited to:

- Senders may not use false or misleading headers.
- Senders may not use deceptive subject lines.
- Senders must give their recipients the option of opting out of commercial email.
- Senders must honor all opt-out requests.

This is by no means a complete description of CAN-SPAM, please visit the [CAN-SPAM Act Compliance Guide](https://www.ftc.gov/tips-advice/business-center/guidance/can-spam-act-compliance-guide-business) for more information.

{% info %}
The guidelines laid out in CAN-SPAM represent the “bare-minimum” regarding sending practices. Following these guidelines does not guarantee delivery to your recipients’ inboxes: CAN-SPAM leaves a considerable amount of room for improvement. Please visit [SendGrid Deliverability Tips and Tricks]({{root_url}}/Classroom/Deliver/index.html) for a more detailed discussion of how you can improve your sending practices.

{% warning %}
CAN-SPAM is not limited to bulk email. Any commercial email communication, including business-to-business and business-to-customer email, is covered by the CAN-SPAM Act.
