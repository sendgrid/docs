Transactional email templates are pre-coded email layouts that marketers, designers, and developers can use to quickly and easily create transactional email campaigns. SendGrid’s transactional email templates allow non-technical and technical people alike to make real-time changes to the email their recipients receive.

In the past, creating an email required marketers to work with designers and developers to develop the final message received by recipients. The SendGrid email template editor relieves a lot of this work by providing marketers and designers with various email layouts they can use within The SendGrid UI. This frees up developers to focus on more important projects, while the marketers can easily create and send their emails.

The [SendGrid transactional email Template Engine]({{site.site_url}}/solutions/email-template-engine) gives each user the ability to create their own templates for each of the transactional emails they need to send. Different email templates can be created, saved. Ands edited for purchase receipt emails, account notification emails, and a completely different one for password reset emails.

The SendGrid Template Engine allows users to modify transactional email templates via WYSIWG or HTML, and it allows users to preview how transactional email templates will look in both [mobile and desktop layout]({{site.blog_url}}/5-tips-designing-email-for-mobile/). The email experts have also created a few [responsive email templates]({{site.blog_url}}/responsive-templates-make-sure-everyone-can-read-email/) so that you can make sure your messages look great on any device.

The design section of the transactional email template engine allows marketers to easily design a template, without the need for complex coding. Developers can then manage multiple templates created with a RESTful API and integrate them into applications.
