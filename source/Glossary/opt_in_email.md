**Opt-in email** refers to bulk email, such as a newsletter or advertisement, that is sent out to a mailing list where every member of that list has actively given you permission to send them email. Without obtaining this permission, your email is likely unwanted or unsolicited, and is liable to be marked as [spam]({{root_url}}/Glossary/spam.html) by the recipient or be “bulked” by the receiving mailbox provider (i.e. delivered directly to the spam folder).

There are several variations of opt-in email:

- **Single Opt-in** refers to the practice of requesting your recipient’s permission to send them email during, and only during, registration.

- **Double Opt-in** refers to the practice of requesting your recipient's permission to send them email twice. For example, you could ask them if they want to receive your email at registration, and then send another email asking them to confirm their permission again.

- **Confirmed Opt-in** refers to the practice of sending confirmation emails to your recipients asking them to confirm their continued interest in receiving your future emails.

Giving your recipients the option to opt-in to receive your email will help to improve your [sender reputation]({{root_url}}/Classroom/Basics/Misc/your_reputation_what_is_it.html) and will prevent your emails from ending up in your recipients’ [spam folders]({{root_url}}/Glossary/bulk_mail_folder.html).

Regardless of your method of obtaining a recipient's permission, it is important to give them the option of **opting-out** of receiving your future emails by including an [unsubscribe link]({{root_url}}/User_Guide/Suppressions/index.html).

{% info %}
[CAN-SPAM]({{root_url}}/Glossary/can_spam.html) requires an opt-out option in all commercial emails, but it’s good practice to provide it in any email to your recipients. CAN-SPAM requires all senders to immediately honor an opt-out request submitted by a recipient.
