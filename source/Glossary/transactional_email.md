Transactional email is relationship content that “facilitates an already agreed-upon transaction or updates a customer about an ongoing transaction.” It includes any email triggered by a user’s interaction with a web application, such as:

* Account Signups
* Password changes
* Purchase Receipts
* Check-ins
* Notifications
* Friend/follower requests

These emails typically contain information a user wants or needs and consequently have the highest open rates across all categories of email.

Our 2012 study revealed that 79% of web applications rank transactional email as an important tool to acquire new customers. Almost 90% rely on it for their customer retention efforts and 71.5% believe it’s important to their overall marketing strategy.
