Transactional email is relationship content that “facilitates an already agreed-upon transaction or updates a customer about an ongoing transaction.” It includes any email triggered by a user’s interaction with a web application, such as:

* Account Signups
* Password changes
* Purchase Receipts
* Check-ins
* Notifications
* Friend/follower requests

These emails typically contain information a user wants or needs and consequently have the highest open rates across all categories of email.

Because transactional email is so desired, you want to make sure that it consistently reaches your customers’ inboxes. In order to ensure strong email deliverability, rely on a trusted cloud-email service like SendGrid.

Transactional email is an incredibly effective communication tool that can help drive revenue, reduce support costs, and build customer loyalty. As the most desired and expected form of email communication, transactional email can help grow your business and should be an integral component of any customer communication program.

To make sure you're sending the most effective Transactional email, make sure you are building a good email with a good visual, concise content, and appropriate headers.

A good visual email means the email shows up in a clear and appealing manner to the consumer. Concise content means the email is formatted clearly and there is a good ratio of text, hyperlinks, and pictures.
