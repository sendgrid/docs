This endpoint allows you to send email over SendGrid’s v3 Web API, the most recent version of our API.

{% info %}
SendGrid provides libraries to help you quickly and easily integrate with the v3 Web API in 7 different languages: [C#](https://github.com/sendgrid/sendgrid-csharp), [Go](https://github.com/sendgrid/sendgrid-go), [Java](https://github.com/sendgrid/sendgrid-java), [NodeJS](https://github.com/sendgrid/sendgrid-nodejs), [PHP](https://github.com/sendgrid/sendgrid-php), [Python](https://github.com/sendgrid/sendgrid-python), and [Ruby](https://github.com/sendgrid/sendgrid-ruby).

For general information about how to use SendGrid's Web API v3, please visit our <a href="{{root_url}}/API_Reference/Web_API_v3/index.html">API Overview</a>.

You may send mail via the v3 Mail Send endpoint via one of two ways:
<ul>
  <li>You can make a <a href="{{root_url}}/Classroom/Send/v3_Mail_Send/curl_examples.html">cURL request</a>.</li>
  <li>You can make an HTTP Post request through one of our <a href="{{root_url}}/Integrate/libraries.html">7 libraries</a>.</li>
</ul>

{% anchor h2 %}

curl -X "POST" "https://api.sendgrid.com/v3/mail/send" -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY" -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d "[YOUR DATA HERE]"
{% endcodeblock %}

You must authenticate every API request to send mail by including an <code>Authorization</code> header. This header should include the authorization type of <code>Bearer</code>, followed by your API Key that has already been assigned the necessary permissions. Click <a href="{{root_url}}/API_Reference/Web_API_v3/How_To_Use_The_Web_API_v3/authentication.html">here</a> for more information.

{% anchor h2 %}
Validation
{% endanchor %}

Whenever you make a request to the v3 Mail Send endpoint, your JSON payload is validated before your email is sent.

If there are any errors, SendGrid will attempt to identify and return as many issues as possible for each request. For more information, please read our <a href="{{root_url}}/API_Reference/Web_API_v3/Mail/errors.html">error documentation</a>.

{% anchor h2 %}
