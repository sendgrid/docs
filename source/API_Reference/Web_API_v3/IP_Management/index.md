{% info %}
The endpoints and features described in IP Management docs are 
only available if you have dedicated IPs for your account. 
To add IPs to your account, please [contact support](http://support.sendgrid.com/hc/en-us).
{% endinfo %}

Using the IP Management API methods, you can create [IP pools]({{root_url}}/API_Reference/Web_API_v3/IP_Management/ip_pools.html), assign
[IP addresses]({{root_url}}/API_Reference/Web_API_v3/IP_Management/ip_addresses.html) to them, and enable [IP warmup]({{root_url}}/API_Reference/Web_API_v3/IP_Management/ip_warmup.html) for the pools
and IP addresses you've created.
