There is no equivalent API call in Marketing Campaigns. You may setup A/B tests directly in the [SendGrid UI](https://sendgrid.com/marketing_campaigns/ui/campaigns). First, navigate to your [Campaigns page](https://sendgrid.com/marketing_campaigns/ui/campaigns), then click on the desired Campaign name. Next, click on the Testing tab and toggle the switch to on.
