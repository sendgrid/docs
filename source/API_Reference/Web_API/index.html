<p>SendGrid offers a Web API that allows customers to retrieve information about their account such as statistics, bounces, spam reports, unsubscribes, and other information. This API is not RESTful since for most calls both GET and POST HTTP verbs can be used interchangeably, and other verbs are not supported.</p>

<p>On API reference pages, you will see a "Try It" button for each method. Clicking this button
will turn the parameters table into a form that you can use to make actual Web API calls
from the website.</p>

<p>In order to use this feature you will need a
