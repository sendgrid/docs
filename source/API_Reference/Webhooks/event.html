<p>SendGrid's Event Webhook will notify a URL of your choice via HTTP POST with information about events that
occur as SendGrid processes your email. A common use of this data is to collect information about how specific 
mail campaigns or categories of mailings are progressing. Using Unique Arguments and Category parameters, 
you can insert dynamic data that will help build a sharp, clear image of your mailings. </p>

{% info %}
If you'd like to see how one of our customers uses the Event Webhook, check out 
<a href="http://sendgrid.com/blog/leveraging-sendgrids-event-api/">Leveraging SendGrid's Event API</a>.

Setup 
{% endanchor %}

{% warning %}
If you enabled the Event Webhook prior to September 6, 2013 you will see a dropdown allowing you to select
Version 1, 2 or 3 of the webhook. Version 3 is the recommended option and the only option available to new users. 
You can read about the older versions on the
<a href="{{root_url}}/API_Reference/Webhooks/event_deprecated.html">Event Webhook (deprecated)</a> page. 
{% endwarning %}

<p>To setup the Event Webhook, login and go to the <a href="http://sendgrid.com/app">apps page</a>, 
click on Show Disabled Apps, click the Event Notification app, and click on settings. Check the boxes next to the 
type of events you want posted to your web server, then enter in the URL you have setup to receive POSTs from our 
servers when an event occurs.</p>

{% info %}
We support basic HTTP authentication in our Event API. Those who wish to implement can provide credentials 
in the post event url field on the app settings page. Below is an example of the post url with authentication included. 
{% endinfo %}

{% codeblock lang:html %}
http(s)://username:password@domain/foo.php
{% endcodeblock %}

{% warning %}
If you wish to receive encrypted posts, we require that your callback URL support SSL v2.
{% endwarning %}

{% anchor h2 %}
Requests 
{% endanchor %}
<p>You will receive a <strong>HTTP POST</strong> containing a JSON array of multiple events in one request after a 
very short delay. These POSTs will be sent to the URL you have defined in the Event Notification app options. </p>

{% info %}
Events currently post every 1 second or when the batch size reaches 1MB (one megabyte), whichever occurs first.
{% endinfo %}

Event POST Example
{% endanchor %}

{% codeblock lang:json %}
[
    {
        "email": "john.doe@sendgrid.com",
        "timestamp": 1337197600,
        "smtp-id": "<4FB4041F.6080505@sendgrid.com>",
        "event": "processed"
    },
    {
        "email": "john.doe@sendgrid.com",
        "timestamp": 1337966815,
        "smtp-id": "<4FBFC0DD.5040601@sendgrid.com>",
        "category": "newuser",
        "event": "clicked"
    },
    {
        "email": "john.doe@sendgrid.com",
        "timestamp": 1337969592,
        "smtp-id": "<20120525181309.C1A9B40405B3@Example-Mac.local>",
        "event": "processed"
    }
]
{% endcodeblock %}

<p>You can test your endpoint by clicking the "Test Your Integration" button in the Event 

<p>SendGrid expects a 200 HTTP response to the POST, otherwise the event notification will be retried. 
If your URL returns a non-200 HTTP code it will be deferred and retried for 24 hours.
The maximum number of deferred POSTs in the retry queue is 100,000. 
If the queue is full, the oldest request in the queue will be removed to make room for the newest deferred POST. 
Events that cannot be submitted within the maximum retry period or events removed from the defer queue will be lost.</p>

{% warning %}
If your email traffic generates lots of events, the incoming data
can easily overload a web server if not configured properly. You can load test your endpoints with <a
  href="http://loader.io">loader.io</a> for free.

{% anchor h2 %}
Unique Arguments and Categories 
{% endanchor %}
<p>Events generated by SendGrid can also include unique arguments. To define and receive custom parameters in your URL 
the <a href="{{root_url}}/API_Reference/SMTP_API/index.html">SMTP API</a> must be used when sending emails using 
the <em>unique_args</em> argument. For example, if you have an application and want to receive custom parameters such 
as the user id and the email template name, include the following in your SMTP headers as X-SMTPAPI or as the 
xsmtpapi parameter of your Web API call: </p>

{% codeblock lang:json %}{
  "unique_args": {
    "userid": "1123",
    "template": "welcome"
  }
}
{% endcodeblock %} 

{% anchor h2 %}
Categories 
{% endanchor %}
<p>If a <a href="{{root_url}}/Delivery_Metrics/categories.html">category</a> is used over the SMTP API to get detailed
statistics for <em>user signups</em> in addition to custom parameter, include the following in your SMTP headers as
X-SMTPAPI or as the xsmtpapi parameter of your Web API call:</p>

{% codeblock lang:json %}{
  "unique_args": {
    "userid": "1123",
    "template": "welcome"
  },
  "category": "user_signup"
}
{% endcodeblock %}

{% info %}
If you apply multiple categories to any of your outgoing messages, the returned data will be in the form of an array.
{% endinfo %}

{% anchor h2 %}
Examples 
{% endanchor %}
The following examples will use PHP language, the Web API to send email using <em>curl</em>, and the <a href="{{root_url}}/API_Reference/SMTP_API/index.html">SMTP API</a> for the <em>X-SMTPAPI</em> parameter when sending email. Many times is useful to see all parameters that are being POSTed. The following example receives a <strong>batched</strong> POST and dumps the parameters to a log file located at /tmp/dump.log:

{% codeblock lang:php %}
<?php
$fh = fopen('/tmp/dump.log', 'a+');
if ( $fh )
{
// Dump body
fwrite($fh, print_r($HTTP_RAW_POST_DATA, true));
fclose($fh);
}
?> ok
{% endcodeblock %}

{% anchor h2 %}
Parameter Details 
{% endanchor %}
<p>The following shows each type of event that can be posted along with the specific parameters that go along with the
event.
</p>

{% info %}
You can use the SMTP API to specify additional custom parameters including categories and unique args. Each unique arg
is posted as a separate post parameter, similar to the category listed below, but with a custom name specified by you.

Troubleshooting 
{% endanchor %}
<p>Ensure that your web server is returning a 200 response to our servers. Any other response type will result in our
server retrying a POST until we receive a 200 response or the maximum time has expired. All events are retried at
increasing intervals for up to 24 hours after the event occurs. Make sure you are not blocking our IPs that are trying 
to POST to your server. Our IPs change often since we constantly add more machines.</p>

<p>You can use the "Test Your Integration" button on the Event Notifications settings page to send simulated events to
your callback URL. You can also send a POST from a shell using cURL. This will give you the full
response your server is returning including the HTTP headers.</p>

{% codeblock lang:bash %}
curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '[{"email":"john.doe@sendgrid.com","timestamp":1337197600,"smtp-id":"<4FB4041F.6080505@sendgrid.com>","event":"processed"},{"email":"john.doe@sendgrid.com","timestamp":1337966815,"smtp-id":"<4FBFC0DD.5040601@sendgrid.com>","category":"newuser","event":"clicked"},{"email":"john.doe@sendgrid.com","timestamp":1337969592,"smtp-id":"<20120525181309.C1A9B40405B3@Example-Mac.local>","event":"processed"}]'
