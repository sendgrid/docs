If you need to see what kind of responses you're going to get from our webhooks, or you need to tunnel directly to your developer environment, there are a selection of tools out there to help you. Here we'll look at a few different options and how to set them up.

{% anchor h2 %}
RequestBin 
{% endanchor %}

[RequestBin](http://requestb.in) works by providing a unique URL that you can set as your endpoint for both the Inbound Parse and the Event Notifications Webhooks. You can then check this URL to see what responses you're getting back from us.

{% anchor h3 %}
Setup 
{% endanchor %}

You may generate a unique URL by creating a "RequestBin"

The URL looks like this:

{% codeblock lang:html %}
http://requestb.in/19e3ycm1
{% endcodeblock %}

 
{% anchor h3 %}
Receive Event Notifications Data 
{% endanchor %}

To have all your event notifications posted to this URL first turn on the [Event Notification app]({{root_url}}/Apps/event_notification.html) in your dashboard.

Next, select which notifications you would like to have send to RequestBin (if in doubt, tick all the checkboxes to turn them all on) and enter the unique URL generated by RequestBin as your Post Event URL at the bottom of the page. Once you've saved the changes, all event notifications will be sent to RequestBin for you to check.

{% anchor h3 %}
Receive Inbound Parse Data 
{% endanchor %}

Before you can receive data through the Inbound Parse Webhook, you will need to follow the [instructions for making changes to your MX records]({{root_url}}/API_Reference/Webhooks/parse.html) in your DNS setup.

Once that has been completed you can [setup your Inbound Parse](https://sendgrid.com/developer/reply). In this case, you need to add your RequestBin URL as the URL to POST to.

{% anchor h3 %}
Seeing the results 
{% endanchor %}

After completing the setup for your chosen webhook, the results can be found by heading to your RequestBin unique URL in a browser.

{% anchor h2 %}
ngrok 
{% endanchor %}

[ngrok](https://ngrok.com/) is a tool for creating a local tunnel to your machine, it makes testing webhooks locally extremely easy.

Start by [signing up](https://ngrok.com/dashboard) so you can use all the features available. In particular, the ability to use custom subdomains. This will remove the need to amend your webhook settings each time you run ngrok.

{% anchor h3 %}
Setup 
{% endanchor %}

To get up and running, install and enter the following in your CLI

{% codeblock lang:html %}
$ ngrok 3000
{% endcodeblock %}

This would open up a connection to port 3000 on your local machine, at a URL like `http://3a4bfceb.ngrok.com`. You may then put this URL as your the URL for your Parse Webhook or Event Webhook.

Rather than having to change this every time you restart ngrok, specify the subdomain flag:

{% codeblock lang:html %}
$ ngrok -subdomain=myappname 3000
{% endcodeblock %}

This will open up port 3000 and make it accessible at `http://myappname.ngrok.com`.

{% anchor h3 %}
Seeing what's happening 
{% endanchor %}

Additionally, ngrok runs a web interface at ``http://localhost:4040</code>, that allows you to monitor requests in and out, as well as giving you the ability to replay previous requests at the click of a button.

For more information on what you can do with ngrok, [check out their documentation](https://ngrok.com/usage).

{% anchor h2 %}
Runscope 
{% endanchor %}

[Runscope](https://runscope.com) is a tool for debugging APIs. It acts as a proxy, collecting all data sent to it and passes it on to another point. You may then, later, review what was sent to the API you're debugging.

This can be extrordinarily helpful when debugging webhooks, and [Runscope has a tutorial on how to do this](https://www.runscope.com/provider-guide/troubleshooting-webhooks).
