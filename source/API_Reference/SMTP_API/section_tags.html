<p>Sections are an extension of <a href="{{root_url}}/API_Reference/SMTP_API/substitution_tags.html">substitution values</a> that allow a user to specify large text blocks that will be mostly the same that can then be selected and customized on a per user basis. This is useful for sending dynamic content where a large section of the body will be similar across several users, as opposed to duplicating that text each time. </p>

<p>The format of the SMTP section key has the form:</p>

{% codeblock lang:json %}{
  "section": {
    "-sectionName1-": "section 1 text",
    "sectionName2": "section 2 text"
  }
}
{% endcodeblock %}

<p>Typical usage is to have a tag in the body of your email that references a per user substitution tag. This user tag will contain a reference to a section tag. Section text may contain references to per recipient substitution variables.</p>

<h3>Section Tag Example</h3>

Message body:
{% codeblock lang:html %}
<html>
 <body>
   Hi -name-,<br>
      We thought you might be interested in this special offer. 
      -body-
 </body>
</html>
{% endcodeblock %}

<p>An accompanying SMTPAPI JSON header might look something like this:</p>

{% codeblock lang:json %}{
  "to": [
    "alice@example.com",
    "joe@example.com"
  ],
  "sub": {
    "-body-": [
      "-bodyFemale-",
      "-bodyMale-"
    ],
    "-name-": [
      "Alice",
      "Joe"
    ]
  },
  "section": {
    "-bodyFemale-": "Check out this dress -name-!",
    "-bodyMale-": "Check out this tie -name-!"
  }
}
{% endcodeblock %}

The final email for Alice would look like this:
{% codeblock lang:html %}
<html>
 <body>
   Hi Alice,<br>
      We thought you might be interested in this special offer. 
      Check out this dress Alice!
 </body>
</html>
{% endcodeblock %}
