<p>Substitution tags allow you to easily generate dynamic content for each recipient on your list. When you send to a list of recipients over SMTP API you can specify substitution values for each recipient like a first name, that will then be inserted into an opening greeting like: "Dear -fistName-" where each recipient sees -firstName- replaced with their first name. </p>

<p>These values can also be used in more complex scenarios, for example instead of a first name you could also use a customerID and replace that value in a custom URL to take that customer to a page specific to them: </p>

{% codeblock lang:html %}
<a href="sendgrid.com/customerOffer?id=-customerID-">Claim your offer!</a>
{% endcodeblock %}

<p>where an ID specific to the customer is appended into the link in place of -customerID-. </p>
<p>You may also use substitution tags in the subject lines of your emails.</p>

<blockquote><span class="label label-info">Info</span> Substitution tags
will work in the Subject line as well as the body of the email. </blockquote>

<blockquote><span class="label label-info">Info</span> How you format your replacement tags may depend on the library you use to create your SMTP connection, the language you are writing your code in, or any intermediate mail servers that your servers will send mail through. In some cases -subVal- may be the best choice while in other %subVal% or #subVal# may make more sense.</blockquote>

<blockquote><span class="label label-warning">Warning</span> Do not use spaces inside your substitution values, e.g. %first name%</blockquote>

Email HTML content:
{% codeblock lang:html %}
<html>
  <head></head>
  <body>
    <p>Hello -name-,<br>
       Thank you for your interest in our products. I have set up an appointment
             to call you at -time- EST to discuss your needs in more detail. If you would

                -contactPhoneNumber-<br>
    </p>
  </body>
</html>
{% endcodeblock %}

<p>An accompanying SMTP API JSON header might look something like this:</p>

{% codeblock lang:javascript %}
{
    "to": [
        "john.doe@gmail.com",
        "jane.doe@hotmail.com"
    ],
    "sub": {
        "-name-": [
            "John",
            "Jane"
        ],
        "-customerID-": [
            "1234",
            "5678"
        ],
        "-salesContact-": [
            "Jared",
            "Ben"
        ],
        "-contactPhoneNumber-": [
            "555.555.5555",
            "777.777.7777"
        ],
        "-time-": [
            "3:00pm",
            "5:15pm"
        ]
    }
}
{% endcodeblock %}

<p>The final email for John would look like this:</p>
{% codeblock lang:html %}
<html>
  <head></head>
