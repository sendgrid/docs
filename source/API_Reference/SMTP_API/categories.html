<p>Categories help organize your email analytics by enabling you to tag emails by type.</p>

<p>Just as you can view the statistics on all your activity under the '<a href="{{root_url}}/Delivery_Metrics/">Statistics</a>' tab, you can go a step further and view the statistics on a particular category.</p>

<p>The events that can be associated with category include:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Emails sent</li>
	<li>Clicks</li>
	<li>Opens</li>
	<li>Bounces</li>
	<li>Spam Reports</li>
	<li>Unsubscribes</li>
</ul>
<p>The actual statistics included vary depending upon the set of enabled <a href="{{root_url}}/Apps/">Apps</a>. Emails sent, bounces and spam reports will always get tracked. Unsubscribes, Clicks, and Opens require that the associated App is enabled.</p>

{% warning %}
Categories must be in 7bit encoding using the US-ASCII character set. 
{% endwarning %}

{% info %}
Currently, there is no limit to the number of categories you can track.
{% endinfo %}

{% info %}
Categories should be used to group messages together. If you need to attach unique data or identifiers to a message, use Unique Arguments instead.

{% anchor h2 %}
Example 
{% endanchor %}
<p>You can use SendGrid's <a href="{{root_url}}/API_Reference/SMTP_API/">SMTPAPI</a> to add these categories to your email. The following should be added to the email's header:</p>

{% codeblock lang:json %}{
  "category": "Example Category"
}
{% endcodeblock %}
<p>In this example, SendGrid would associate statistics for the email containing that header with the category <strong>Example Category</strong>.</p>

<p>You can assign multiple categories per message, up to 10:</p>

{% codeblock lang:json %}{
  "category": [
    "dogs",
    "animals",
    "pets",
    "mammals"
  ]
}
{% endcodeblock %}
