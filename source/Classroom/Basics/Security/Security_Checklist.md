SendGrid doesn’t compromise when it comes to compromised accounts and neither should you. Every day that you put off security steps, your reputation as a business and a sender is at risk. Take a few minutes, go through this checklist and make sure that your systems are secure.

1) &nbsp;Is your password robust? &nbsp;(If your account is compromised, do a virus scan prior to changing your password in order to get rid of any&nbsp;key-logger's.)

- Do you use the same password for multiple sites?

  - vary your passwords from site to site

- Do you use both upper- and lower-case letters?
- Do you use one or more numerical digits?
- Do you use special characters? (e.g. @, #, $ etc.)
- Don’t use easily guessable words or phrases such as:

  - words found in a dictionary or the user's personal information.
  - passwords that match the format of calendar dates, telephone numbers, or other common numbers.
  - your company name or an abbreviation.

2) &nbsp;Do you avoid having web browsers save your password?  

3) &nbsp;Do you perform regular virus scans on any computers that are used to send mail through SendGrid or login to your account?  

4) &nbsp;Are your wireless network connections secure and encrypted?  

5) &nbsp;Is a firewall enabled on your machine?  

6) &nbsp;Do you have configuration files or web pages (Facebook, Twitter, Linkdin, etc.) that contain your SendGrid credentials? Make sure they are not indexable via a search engine or visible in any way to outsiders.  

7) &nbsp;Are any web applications on your web servers vulnerable? &nbsp;Make sure these are up to date. &nbsp;(for example old versions of WordPress are vulnerable to exploitation). &nbsp;Please review:&nbsp;http://codex.wordpress.org/Hardening\_WordPress for hardening your security with WordPress.  

8) &nbsp;Are there any rogue web scripts/forms on your server?  

9) &nbsp;If you have a website sending emails through SendGrid, are there checks in place to prevent visitors (or bots) from sending email in large volumes or in any way that is abusive? &nbsp;If you have an email registration form, [here](http://support.sendgrid.com/entries/21856326-keeping-your-registration-form-secure) are some helpful tips to keep your form secure.   

10) &nbsp;Do you have a mail server which routes outbound mail through SendGrid? &nbsp;Is it misconfigured as an open relay?

11) You can use services like [stopthehacker.com](http://www.stopthehacker.com/) which can give your website a&nbsp;vulnerability assessment, check for web malware, and offer&nbsp;guidance for better security.
