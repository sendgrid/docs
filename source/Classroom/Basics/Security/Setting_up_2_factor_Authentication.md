To setup 2-Factor Authentication, simply log in to your account and visit the&nbsp; [Setup Multifactor Authentication](https://sendgrid.com/multifactor/configure) page. From here, simply enter in your cell phone number and SendGrid will send a code to your phone. Once you verify the code you will be all set!&nbsp;

A few things to note;

- [To turn off 2FA, you will need to contact us,](/hc/en-us/articles/204232503-How-can-I-turn-off-2-factor-authentication-)&nbsp;there is not a way via the UI.
- 2- Factor can only go to 1 phone so multiple&nbsp;credential&nbsp;users will need to have access to the main phone.&nbsp;
- Enabling this feature will require you to verify a 6 digit code SMSed to your phone each time you log in to Sendgrid.com.&nbsp;This&nbsp;does not effect API&nbsp;access.

**Please note that enabling 2FA will also require any Multiple Credentials associated with the main account to use a&nbsp;verification code when logging in as well.&nbsp;**
