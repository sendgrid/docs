Poor security practices put your reputation as a business and a sender at risk. Use these suggestions to improve the security of your system.

**1) Use a robust password!**

Password Do’s
- Use upper and lower case letters, numerals, and special characters.
- Set up [Teammates](https://sendgrid.com/docs/User_Guide/Settings/teammates.html) to create, manage, and restrict additional sets of credentials to more precisely grant permissions within your SendGrid account.

Password Don'ts
- Don’t use the same password for multiple sites. Vary your passwords whenever possible.
- Don’t use easily guessable words or phrases such as personal information, your company name, or abbreviations.
- Don’t expose your password on public repositories like Github, in the notes in the HTML on web pages, or on social media.

**2) Don’t let web browsers automatically save your SendGrid password.**

**3) Perform regular virus scans on any computers that are used to send mail through SendGrid or are used login to your account.**

**4) Encrypt and secure wireless connections.**

**5) Check for vulnerabilities in your web applications, and always make sure they are completely up to date.**

   Software updates often fix vulnerabilities. For example, old versions of WordPress are vulnerable to exploitation. Review the [Harden WordPress](https://codex.wordpress.org/Hardening_WordPress) documentation that will introduce you to basic security concepts and serve as a guide to making your WordPress website more secure.

**6) If you have a service that is sending emails through SendGrid, be sure there are checks in place to prevent visitors (or bots) from sending unwanted email in large volumes.**

   If you have an email registration form, [here are some helpful tips]({{root_url}}/Classroom/Basics/Security/keeping_your_registration_form_secure.html) to keep your form secure.

SendGrid will never send you an email asking you to provide you account password, API keys, or Credit/Debit Card information. Please report any account phishing attempts to abuse@sendgrid.com.
