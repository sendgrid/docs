To download lists of your suppressed addresses, such as [bounces](https://app.sendgrid.com/suppressions/bounces) or [unsubscribes](https://app.sendgrid.com/suppressions/global_unsubscribes?), you are able to retrieve them directly and securely via your SendGrid account. To protect your privacy, we secure your download with an encrypted HTTPS connection. If you would rather have us send the lists to you via an alternate secure channel, please contact our support team and we will encrypt your suppression lists before sending them to your authorized address.

We also offer a secure channel for you to upload suppression files. Please [contact our support team](https://support.sendgrid.com/hc/en-us) for more information.
