_"Can I add more email&nbsp;to my account?"&nbsp;_ This is a question I hear often from SendGrid users&nbsp;and I would like to clear it all up today. **You cannot manually add more emails&nbsp;to an account,** &nbsp;however most plans allow for overages.

If you are on the Free plan and need of more emails, you will need to upgrade plans.&nbsp;

**Free plans** have a limit of 12,000 emails per month. After 12,000&nbsp;requests have been made we will simply reject your requests. It is very import to keep track of how many emails you are sending and you can see this on your account overview page. We have no way to tell you when emails started becoming rejected. :(

**Lite plans** start off with a daily limit of 1000 emails&nbsp;per day for 1 week and the more you send constantly with a good IP reputation, SendGrid will increase your credits. Read more [here](https://sendgrid.com/docs/User_Guide/sending_practices.html)&nbsp;. Again, it is very import to keep track of how many emails you are sending and you can see this on your account overview page.

**Essentials&nbsp;plan's** &nbsp;have a monthly limit of 40,000/100,000 emails&nbsp;per month but we do allow overages at $1.00 per every 1000 emails.&nbsp;

**Pro&nbsp;plan's** &nbsp;have a monthly limit of 100,000, 300,000 and 700,000 emails&nbsp;per month but we do allow overages at $0.85, $0.50 and $0.45 per every 1000 emails.&nbsp;
