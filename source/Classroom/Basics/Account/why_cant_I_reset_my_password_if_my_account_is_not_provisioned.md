You will not be able to reset the password for an account where your email address has [not yet been confirmed]({{root_url}}/Classroom/Troubleshooting/Account_Administration/cant_log_in_to_your_account.html). However, you will also not be able confirm your email address and activate the account without knowing your account’s username and the password. So how do you move forward?

As it turns out, the only option would be to [create another account](https://sendgrid.com/pricing). Once the new account is created, please [reach out to support](http://support.sendgrid.com) and let us know what the new username is and what happened, so we can expedite the provisioning process for you. We can then make sure you are not turned down due to signing up for multiple accounts with the same information. Remember, you are only charged for paid accounts after you are successfully provisioned, so there is no need to worry when creating a new paid account to get around this scenario.
