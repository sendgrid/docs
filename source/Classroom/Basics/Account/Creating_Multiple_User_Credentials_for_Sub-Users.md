There are a few ways to create multiple user credentials for your sub-users.&nbsp;

1. Login directly as the sub-user. Click on account settings, then Manage Multiple User Credentials and add your new MUC. **You will not be able to add a going through Subuser Management. You need to login directly as a sub-user.**
