We're sorry to see anyone leave, but things happen and we totally understand. If you want to cancel your account, you can [do it&nbsp;here](https://app.sendgrid.com/settings/billing).&nbsp;

Cancellations take full effect on the first day of the next calendar month, at which point your account will still be usable, but will be at the Free package level. &nbsp;

&nbsp;

We wish you the best of&nbsp;luck in your future email endeavors, &nbsp;we'll always have Paris. <3
