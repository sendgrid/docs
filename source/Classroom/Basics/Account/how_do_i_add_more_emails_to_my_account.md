_"Can I add more emails to my account?"_ is a common question from SendGrid users, and the answer is that because of the subscription based model of SendGrid plans, _you cannot manually add more emails to an account_. **However, all plans except for the Free and Legacy Lite plans allow for overages, which means that you can send beyond your monthly allowance for a small per-email fee.**


**Free plans** have a limit of 12,000 emails per month. After 12,000 requests have been made we will simply reject your requests. It is very import to keep track of how many emails you are sending and you can see this on your account overview page. If you are on the Free plan and are in need of more emails, you will need to [upgrade your account]({{root_url}}/Classroom/Basics/Billing/how_do_i_upgrade_or_downgrade_my_account.html).

**Essentials plans**  have a monthly limit of 40,000/100,000 emails per month, with overages at a rate of $1.00 per every 1000 emails in excess of your plan limit.

**Pro plans**  have a monthly limit of 100,000, 300,000, or 700,000 emails per month, with overages at a rate of $0.85, $0.50 or $0.45 per every 1000 emails in excess of your plan limit.

**[Legacy Lite plans]({{root_url}}/Classroom/Basics/Billing/legacy_lite_plan.html)** start off with a daily limit of 1000 emails per day for 1 week and the more you send constantly with a good IP reputation, SendGrid will increase your credits.

If you are on the Lite plan and are in need of more emails, you will need to [upgrade your account]({{root_url}}/Classroom/Basics/Billing/how_do_i_upgrade_or_downgrade_my_account.html).
