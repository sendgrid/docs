[Multiple User Credentials](https://sendgrid.com/docs/User_Guide/Account/multiple_credentials.html) is a feature that allows administrators to create and manage additional user access to SendGrid features and allows the ability to send messages without sharing access to the master account credentials.

You may find yourself in a position where you have been given a set of Multiple Credentials for access to a specific aspect of a Sendgrid account. Potential Use cases may include: 

- Developer credentials for integration purposes.
- UI access only for viewing metrics. 
- Control over a subuser account by way of secondary Multiple Credentials.

 

**If you use Multiple Credentials, but would like to reset the password, you will need to get in touch with the owner of the primary account and ask them to reset the password on your behalf.**

Currently there is no method for Multiple Credential users to change those credentials themselves.
