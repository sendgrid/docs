By default, we limit the amount of subusers a Pro&nbsp;(or higher) account has to 15. If you find yourself needing more than 15, please contact Support, and we can help you get more added. You'll see the contact Support options at the lower on this page.

Just so you are aware, the support agent will likely ask a few questions about what you will be using&nbsp;subusers&nbsp;for and the volume you might be sending over them. Don't worry though, we're only asking so we can help you have the best experience possible with new subusers.&nbsp;

Read more about what subusers are, and what features they have&nbsp; [here](http://support.sendgrid.com/hc/en-us/articles/200181918-What-are-Subusers-).
