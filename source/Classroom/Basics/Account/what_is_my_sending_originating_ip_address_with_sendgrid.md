# Do I have a dedicated IP?

Depending on your package level you either have a dedicated sending IP address or you are using a shared sending IP address.

- All Pro+ customers are given dedicated sending IPs. &nbsp;
- Free, Lite, and Essential&nbsp;customers all share sending IP addresses.

# One IP

You can find your accountâ€™s main IP address on your Account Overview page. It is towards the bottom on the left hand side.&nbsp;
