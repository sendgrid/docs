On July 6th, 2015 we changed the layout of our website to improve usability. This article aims to help you find the features you're used to in the new user interface. 

 

In our old interface, you may have been used to going to your Apps section, and then enabling Subscription Tracking. This now resides in the **[Tracking](https://app.sendgrid.com/settings/tracking)** section of your account, underneath **Settings**.
