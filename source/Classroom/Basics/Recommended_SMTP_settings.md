 **Integrate with Sendgrid using SMTP**

- Change your SMTP authentication username and password to your **SendGrid&nbsp;username and password,** or set up a [Multiple Credential](https://sendgrid.com/docs/User_Guide/multiple_credentials.html) with "mail" enabled.&nbsp;
- Set the server host to **smtp.sendgrid.net.** This setting can sometimes be referred to as the external SMTP server, or relay, by some programs and&nbsp;services.

**Ports**

- Use port **25** or **587** for unencrypted / TLS&nbsp;connections
- Use port **465** for SSL connections

**We recommend using port** _ **587** _ to avoid potential rate limiting. It is also the least likely to be blocked by corporate and residential ISP settings.&nbsp;

When using SMTP, You can send 100 messages per SMTP connection at a time, and open up to 10 concurrent connections from a single server at a time.
