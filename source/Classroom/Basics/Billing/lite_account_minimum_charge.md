The Lite package has a minimum charge of $1/month. &nbsp;This policy change took effect for new accounts starting in June. &nbsp;The charge was implemented for existing accounts starting in August, but due to billing issues the August charge did not appear until this month.

For all Lite accounts, you will see a $1 minimum monthly charge going forward. &nbsp;An email notice was sent to all Lite customers, notifying you of the change. &nbsp;

But we know that communications like this are easy to miss. &nbsp;If you wish to have your account converted to a Free account (limit of 400 emails per day), and the $2 charge refunded, please contact support and we’ll make the change to your account.&nbsp;
