SendGrid charges&nbsp;every account on a month-to-month subscription basis, at&nbsp;the beginning of the month your credit card on file will&nbsp;be automatically charged&nbsp;in full for the following stuff:

- The price of your current package.
- Any overages or usage charges from&nbsp;the previous month.
- Email Marketing&nbsp;usage charges from&nbsp;the previous month, if applicable.

&nbsp;

**FAQS**

**Do credits roll over?**

Credits don't roll over from month to month, any unused credits from the previous month are lost when your subscription refreshes. So be sure you're at&nbsp;the package level that is right for you!&nbsp;

&nbsp;

**I missed a payment, what happens next?**

Accounts with outstanding balances over 7 days old will&nbsp;be suspended due to nonpayment. As soon as you can [update your payment info](/hc/en-us/articles/200183078-Update-your-Credit-Card-Resubmit-Payments), your account will become active again.

Accounts&nbsp;that have&nbsp;unpaid invoices and are still suspended during the last week of the month will be Terminated, and access revoked until the balance is settled. Contact support using the options below to get your account re-activated from a billing terminated state.&nbsp;

&nbsp;

**I received a Payment Failed message.**

If you receive a _Payment Failed_ message, you can [update your credit card here](/hc/en-us/articles/200183078-Update-your-Credit-Card-Resubmit-Payments). You can update the expiration date on an existing card or enter a new card. Also, if you now have sufficient funds on your current card, you can retry an outstanding charge.

&nbsp;

**How do overages work?** &nbsp;

Depending on your package, you will be charged a small amount per-email&nbsp;for each email that you send beyond the credit limit of your current package. Any&nbsp;overage charges are added to the invoice of the month _after_ the over-limit sending occurred.&nbsp;

Note: Upgrading your account does NOT absorb overage charges already incurred, so make sure you are using the right package for your usage case.

**What is this "Contact List Storage"&nbsp;item on my invoice?**

You may&nbsp;see a&nbsp;"Contact List Storage"&nbsp;item on your monthly invoices. This only applies to customers who are using the online Marketing Campaigns&nbsp;feature set. Marketing Campaigns&nbsp;usage is charged at a rate determined by the number of contacts&nbsp;hosted by our service on your account. Your monthly&nbsp;invoice includes charges for contact list storage&nbsp;during the previous month.

You will be billed $10 for every 10,000 contacts. Your first 2,000 contacts are free.
