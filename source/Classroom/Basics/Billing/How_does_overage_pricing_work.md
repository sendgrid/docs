Thereâ€™s an overage charge per email that changes depending on the package. This overage charge comes into play when you start to send emails beyond your monthly subscription amount.&nbsp;

You can see the cost for overages on the [Pricing&nbsp;page](https://sendgrid.com/transactional-email/pricing) for each package. **&nbsp;**
