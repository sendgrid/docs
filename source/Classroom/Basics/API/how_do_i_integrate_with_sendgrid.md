There are many&nbsp;different ways to use SendGrid’s email services so it all comes down to what&nbsp;_you_&nbsp;need. We have numerous examples for how to configure mail clients such as Outlook and Apple Mail to send through our system as well as integration examples for a multitude of programming languages and libraries on our&nbsp; [SendGrid Integration Page](http://sendgrid.com/docs/Integrate/index.html).

**The main ways you can integrate with Sendgrid:&nbsp;**

- [SMTP](http://support.sendgrid.com/hc/en-us/articles/202821898-What-is-SMTP-)&nbsp;- Send using a desktop mail client, or existing program/service with [your smtp credentials](http://support.sendgrid.com/hc/en-us/articles/200328026-What-are-my-settings-for-SMTP-integration-).&nbsp;
- [Web API](https://sendgrid.com/docs/API_Reference/Web_API/index.html)&nbsp;- Send from your app using&nbsp; [your api key](http://support.sendgrid.com/hc/en-us/articles/200181818-What-is-my-API-key-). Check out our [API Guide](http://go.sendgrid.com/rs/sendgrid/images/SendGrid_API_Guide-101.pdf) for more info.
- [Email Marketing App and API](https://sendgrid.com/docs/User_Guide/Legacy_Features/Marketing_Emails/index.html)&nbsp;- Send from our content creation UI and manage your lists via the website.&nbsp;

&nbsp;

**Things to consider before you start sending:**

- We recommend that all Silver and higher customers complete [Whitelabeling](http://support.sendgrid.com/entries/21195838-whitelabel-why-do-i-need-to-make-dns-changes-silver) for their accounts. This process helps your emails look as legitimate as possible!
- Also consider implementing the&nbsp; [Event API](http://sendgrid.com/docs/API_Reference/Webhooks/event.html)&nbsp;to track and log your email data more thoroughly. For more info on the benefits of Event API, check out our&nbsp; [_Why Event API_](http://support.sendgrid.com/entries/21233621-why-event-api)&nbsp;article. The Event API is available to all account levels except for Lite.
- We _ **highly** _ recommend that if you are a Silver or&nbsp;higher customer, you [warm up your IP](https://sendgrid.com/docs/User_Guide/warming_up.html) as part of your getting started checklist. Warming up is one of the best ways to prevent delivery issues down the road!
