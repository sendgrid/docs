Marketing Campaigns makes it simple to understand how customers are (or arenâ€™t) engaging with your campaigns. You can view in aggregate how many times your campaign was opened, the number of clicks within your campaign, and the specific recipients who either opened or clicked within your campaign.

These engagement statistics can provide valuable insight not only into how well your campaigns are performing, but also which recipients are the most (or least) engaged with your content.

Cultivate Engaged Recipients

Creating a dynamic segment of recipients who have either opened one of your campaigns or have clicked within a campaign can be useful in many ways. As one example, you can use engagement metrics to identify who has engaged with a campaign, and then send them a highly-relevant follow-up message that builds on the first campaign they demonstrated interest in.

You can also use engagement data to optimize your sending cadence. For instance, recipients who have opened or clicked your content are expressing interest in what you have to say, and may like to receive more frequent messages.

Of course, in order to protect your reputation as a sender, it is important to test sending frequency by monitoring the engagement of recipients as you send more frequently. If you see your overall engagement start to dip after increasing your frequency, you should immediately re-evaluate the increase.

Reignite Relationships With Unengaged Recipients
{% endanchor %}

Identifying recipients who have not engaged with one of your campaigns can often be just as useful as identifying those who are engaged.

One strategy is to create a segment of recipients who rarely engage with your campaigns. This can help you identify recipients who are not responding to your current content strategy, and test new approaches. This might include different subject matter, subject lines, offers, or sending frequency (i.e sending monthly rather than weekly).

Sometimes having a very large percentage of unengaged recipients indicates that your contact list is becoming stale. In this situation, we recommend you consider sending an email to your unengaged recipients explicitly asking if they would like to continue hearing from you, and if so, how. This is a smart, simple way to improve your deliverability and maintain your positive reputation as a sender.
