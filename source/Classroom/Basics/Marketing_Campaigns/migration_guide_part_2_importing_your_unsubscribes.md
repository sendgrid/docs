Preserving your existing users' subscription preferences is super&nbsp;important to maintaining good deliverability.&nbsp;

This guide aims to show you how you bring your list-specific Unsubscribes from our Legacy Newsletter service over to our Advanced Supression manager, and use them with our new Marketing Campaigns.&nbsp;

**1. Export your list Unsubscribes**

First, head over you the [old Recipient List dashboard](https://sendgrid.com/newsletter/lists)&nbsp;in the&nbsp;Legacy Newsletter&nbsp;service, and **Export** the Recipient List you want to migrate&nbsp;over.&nbsp;

Be sure to only select " **Unsubscribes Emails**" in the Export modal. &nbsp;

&nbsp;And now you're done! You will now be able to select this ASM groups when building a campaign, so that&nbsp;when you send your campaign, any users who had previously unsubscribed will&nbsp;remain undisturbed.
