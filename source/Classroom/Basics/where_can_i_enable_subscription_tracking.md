On July 6th, 2015 we changed the layout of our website to improve usability. This article aims to help you find the features you're used to in the new user interface.&nbsp;

&nbsp;

In our old interface, you may have been used to going to your Apps section, and then enabling Subscription Tracking. This now resides in the **[Tracking](https://app.sendgrid.com/settings/tracking)**&nbsp;section of your account, underneath **Settings**.&nbsp;
