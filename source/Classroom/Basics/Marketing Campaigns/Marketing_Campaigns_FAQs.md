- 

Do stats include ones for mail I send over the SMTPAPI and WebAPI?

  - 

A: No, these stats are specific to the mail you send over Marketing Campaigns only.

- 

How do I find stats for a specific campaign?

  - 

A: You can go into the settings menu after your campaign has started sending, and there will be a link for “Stats”.

- 

Is there a way for me to get more stats than are shown on the UI?

  - A: You can always export a CSV of raw stats for any of your campaigns. That will include stats like CTR, total open rates, spam report rate, and more.
