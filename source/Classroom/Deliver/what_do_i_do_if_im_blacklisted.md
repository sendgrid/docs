Ending up on a blacklist can be detrimental to your domain’s email deliverability. &nbsp;All major ISPs use some form of blacklisting service in order to protect their customers from malicious emails, although not all blacklisting services are actively being used. If a listing service ever asks you pay a fee for a delisting request, or if they say that they do not accept delisting requests, then you should not waste your time trying to get your domain/IP delisted because these services are rarely, if ever, used. However, if you find that your IP address has been blacklisted by one of the many legitimate services, then submitting a delisting request is the top priority. &nbsp;Depending on the level of your account, you should approach a blacklisting in one of two ways:

&nbsp;

**Shared IP Plans (Free, Lite, Bronze, Shared Marketing)**

&nbsp;

If you are on one of our shared IP plans and you notice a block message based on one of our IP addresses then please contact our Support team. &nbsp;We will handle all delisting requests for our shared IP users.

&nbsp;

**Dedicated IP Plans (Silver, Gold, Platinum, High Volume)**

&nbsp;

We ask that our dedicated IP plan users make the initial delisting request in the event that they discover their SendGrid IP on a blacklist. These IP addresses are only assigned to one account at a time, so we expect those users to take responsibility for all of the mail that is sent through their account. &nbsp;SendGrid will still be happy to step in and assist with these delisting requests if the listing service requires the IP administrator to take action, or if the delisting form is too complicated.

&nbsp;

_Please note: &nbsp;in the event that a sending domain (and not the IP address) is blacklisted, that domain’s controller will be responsible for handling the delisting request._

&nbsp;

**Checking Your IP Address**

&nbsp;

Here are two aggregation websites that anyone can use to check on the status of their IP:

- [http://multirbl.valli.org/](http://multirbl.valli.org/)
- [http://www.mxtoolbox.com/blacklists.aspx](http://www.mxtoolbox.com/blacklists.aspx "Link: http://www.mxtoolbox.com/blacklists.aspx")

&nbsp;
