List Management
{% endanchor %}

<p>
  Collecting a list of interested and engaged recipients is the first step that you should take to ensure the delivery of your email, and to keep your recipients from reporting your emails as spam. For more information about list management, see our <a href="{{root_url}}/User_Guide/Marketing_Campaigns/Managing_Contacts/building_your_contact_list.html">documentation.</a>

Spam
{% endanchor %}

<p>
  Spam is simply defined as <strong>unwanted</strong> email. Your emails might be sent to the spam folder, or marked as spam by your recipients because you are sending to the wrong people, or because your content is caught by spam filters. Here are several articles discussing spam, and what to do if your emails are marked as such.
