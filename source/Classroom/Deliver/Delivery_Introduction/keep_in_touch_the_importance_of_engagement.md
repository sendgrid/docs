A common problem for senders is when a recipient will opt-in to receive their emails but after a certain period of time, these opted in emails do not make it to the mailbox. Worse, this leads to recently opted in addresses missing out on this senders emails as well. These addresses have opted in so what is the issue? 

Monitoring engagement is the best tool in ensuring a good reputation as a sender. In the past few years, there has been a large push in determine whether emails will make it to the mailbox by past engagement with that sender. Popular receiving mailboxes like [Gmail](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nt3gE9dGHQ), Yahoo! and [Hotmail](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NHVQD6Sddtg) all use engagement tracking to decipher for their users which emails to put in the spam folder, bounce, or allow passage to a user's mailbox. Furthermore, many mailboxes now have the option to prioritize emails automatically so that there are two different categories of email; those deemed by the mailbox as important and those that aren't. This is almost entirely determined by whether or not recipients click on their emails or even better, if they reply. This increases the ante for senders to send content that recipients will engage with. 

Thankfully SendGrid provides a window into the problem. Senders on the Essentials, Pro, or Premier plans are able to make use of the [Event API](http://sendgrid.com/docs/API_Reference/Webhooks/event.html) which allows senders to know if recipients have opened and/or clicked on their emails. Lower tier plans can view this information under the Email Activity tab. With these tools, a sender can ensure that they are not sending to two major pitfalls:  [spam traps]({{root_url}}/Classroom/Deliver/Undeliverable_Email/spam_trapped.html) or recipients that are likely to acknowledge the email as spam. Sending to either of these recipients leads the receiving mailbox to believe that they are uninterested and therefore, begin to divert their emails to the unimportant or spam folders. 

Monitoring engagement provides a sustainable solution to sending that leaves both the sender and the recipients better off.
