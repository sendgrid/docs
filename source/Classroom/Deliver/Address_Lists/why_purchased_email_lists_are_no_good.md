As an Email Service Provider striving to ensure the highest level of deliverability, SendGrid does not allow sending to email lists that are purchased, rented, or acquired from 3rd party sources without explicit permission granted from the recipient. Why is this? The reason is to benefit both our business and your own.

 

Why you should care:

Purchased lists are almost always poor in quality. They are plagued with old addresses, and often have [Spam Traps or Honeypots]({{root_url}}/Classroom/Deliver/Undeliverable_Email/spam_trapped.html) in the lists. Sending to a list of poor quality will ultimately result in only a fraction of your emails being delivered successfully to the inbox, with even a smaller fraction actually being opened by your disinterested recipients. We say disinterested recipients because these recipients have not explicitly opted into your emails when you use a purchased list. Furthermore, sending to Spam Traps or Honeypots and addresses that mark your mail as spam hurts your sending reputation, and decrease in your future email deliverability. ISP’s or blacklist services take action and refuse to deliver your email and further decrease your deliverability. It may take months, even years, to recover your sending reputation.

Sending to purchased lists gives your business a bad reputation. If you were to receive someone else’s emails without ever having heard of or signed up for their products and/or services, wouldn’t you be a little bit peeved? Nowadays, everybody has a lot to keep track of especially concerning email and other forms of electronic communication. Extra unsolicited email is just a nuisance. Shoving your business advertisements down the throats of unassuming recipients is an excellent way to have your business labeled as disrespectful and unprofessional. You will certainly have a hard time growing your business with this kind of reputation. The optimal way to grow your business via email is to build a community of people that have explicitly expressed interest in your service and/or product by submitting their contact email voluntarily.

 

Why we care:

We care about your business. As part of our general mission to make email better, we want you and your business to succeed by maximizing the effectiveness of the emails that you trust us to deliver.

Our reputation suffers with yours. As we provide the IP space for your email to be sent on, your sending has a direct impact on our industry reputation. When your email is sent with negative results, we are burdened with a poor reputation as well. We strive to maintain excellent relationships with ISPs and other partners in the email industry in order to provide you the best email deliverability possible. A big part of ensuring that this privilege continues is having high standards and firm requirements for the quality of email that we allow to be sent with our system. Ultimately, sending to purchased lists hurts your deliverability, our reputation, and with it, the deliverability and reputation of other SendGrid users.
