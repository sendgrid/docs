Every time a sender breaks our [Terms of Service](http://sendgrid.com/email_policy.html) by purchasing a list the answer is always the same: “To grow their recipient list.” This is completely understandable because typically there is no malice and the list advertisers make it sound like the recipients are genuinely interested in your content. There is inertia and potential. Gaining exposure to potential buyers and promoting your product is essential to the success of any business, but it won’t work. This is spamming. A common misconception is that the greater quantity of recipients means greater results. The truth is that quality is the anthem of success. A list full of engaged, excited recipients will yield a sender far better results in the short run and even more in the long run. Customers’ attention cannot just be bought; it must be earned. Legendary email marketer Seth Godin summed it up best, "Earning permission is a long-term, profitable, scalable strategy that pays for itself. Think about how much better off a brand would be if it took the time to make promises, keep them and be transparent about its communications."

 

How to grow your email list healthily and with great results:



1. The closest alternative is co-registration with relevant partner ventures. This is basically promoting your own site or organization through the opt-in process of similar businesses. This should be done clearly in the opt-in process and explicit as opposed to a small pre-checked box that demonstrates their interest in your organization. Clear opt-in will always yield the best results.



2. Get out there and promote. This could be a sign up in a store or through an conference of people that are already interested in your area of work. Think about where the people that could be interested and go to them. But be wary of hand written sign up forms or verbal exchanges which are often plagued with typos. This puts the sender in danger of sending to email addresses that are uninterested in their content as well as causing the sender to miss out on possible interest in what they are promoting. A better alternative is to have electronic sign ups on a computer or some sort of electronic device.



3. That said, the more easy and accessible the opt-in form, the more likely people are to sign up. Keep it simple and be clear as to what you are going to be sending. Make your registration form stand out, people should not have to search for it. Remember to keep it secure with these [tips]({{root_url}}/Classroom/Basics/Security/keeping_your_registration_form_secure.html).



4. Think about what your expertise is and share it by writing an e-book! This is a great way to inform people about your industry and what you could have to offer them.



5. Try mobile! Try putting in a separate opt-in on your website where people can opt-in to text or SMS alerts for new deals or promotions that you have.


6. Facebook is a great way to promote. Set up a Facebook page to connect with your recipients and promote in fun ways like contests and giveaways. Reward your loyal followers. Put a email registration form on your page to strengthen your connection. Make sure that there are benefits to joining the email list such as a personal birthday promotion.

 

7. Make it easy for your fans to promote your organization. Add a simple form to your website where fans can send an invite or just let their friends know about what you have to offer. But first, swing by our [guidelines]({{root_url}}/Classroom/Deliver/Address_Lists/peer_initiated_email_invitation_requirements.html) to make sure that your campaign will be done safely and successfully. 


 8. Keep your content captivating. Think about who you are sending to and what they would be interested in. The key to successful promotion is to find the people that will be excited about what you offer. Those are the people that spread your ideas. Seth Godin released a helpful  [checklist](http://sethgodin.typepad.com/seths_blog/2008/06/email-checklist.html) to run through every time an email is sent that will help you make sure you deliver great content.
