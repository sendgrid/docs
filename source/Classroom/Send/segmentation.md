I’m trying to create a segment and am looking for partial words on my word custom fields. Why doesn’t it return anything?

  - 

A: We only allow full word search on text custom field values. The only exception is for email address, which allows you to search for parts of a word (eg searching for “gmail” would return [gmail.com](http://gmail.com/), [gmail.cn](http://gmail.cn/), [x.gmail.com](http://x.gmail.com/) email addresses)

- 

How can I find a list of people who have opened / clicked my campaign?

  - 

A: You can do this through segmentation by picking Engagement:Opens or Engagement:Clicks from the dropdown, then going through the flow to find contacts who have/haven’t opened/clicked. Then you can email them or export them, whichever you wish!
