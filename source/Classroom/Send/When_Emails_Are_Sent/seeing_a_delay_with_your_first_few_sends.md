SendGrid will occasionally slow sending for **new accounts** to evaluate and analyze traffic. This temporary delay is designed to ensure that as you scale with SendGrid, you can have confidence that youâ€™ll be able to get the best possible deliverability. The length of this evaluation period can vary but you can always [contact support](https://support.sendgrid.com) to see about expediting the process.
