If your business is adult in nature, we can send your mail to the same standards and deliverability as any of our other customers. However, **_We do not allow our users to send explicit content within emails._** This applies primarily to images.

If you are unsure where your emails stand, one of our sales deliverability experts can&nbsp;help evaluate your sending and provide further detail.&nbsp;Sales can be reached at&nbsp; **sales@sendgrid.com**
