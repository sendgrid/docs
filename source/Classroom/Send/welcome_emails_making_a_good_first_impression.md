Much like meeting someone new for the first time, first impressions can make a huge difference in email. Welcome emails allow you to really hit it off with new subscribers. Because your welcome email if the beginning of your relationship with your subscriber, it is considered to be the most crucial message you send. A great welcome email should have a friendly tone, clear branding, set up future email expectations, and encourage users to engage with your product or service. Make sure to include any unsubscribe, website, customer service, and preference center links you may have.&nbsp;

Welcome emails can also double as a confirmed opt-in message. Confirmed opt-in is a **&nbsp;** industry recommended best practice &nbsp;that helps document permission between sender and recipient, while also eliminating invalid email addresses collected through online forms, in person, or over the phone. By combining your welcome email with your conformation message, you can ensure that your conversation gets off to a great start.&nbsp;
