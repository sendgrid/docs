SendGrid occasionally gets the question "Why isn't my email to sms working?"

The answer is...because the SMTP-to-SMS gateways have narrow bandwidth, due to the need for mobile carriers to predict network traffic, AND as a way to prevent spam to their users. Furthermore, mobile carriers are not incentivized to successfully deliver SMTP-to-SMS messages, since they often provide this as a free service. Senders will see deferrals and blocks if they attempt to send high volumes without reaching a payment agreement with mobile carriers ahead of time.&nbsp;

If senders need this functionality, a different technology, such as&nbsp; [Twilio](http://www.twilio.com/sms), would be more appropriate.&nbsp;

Hereâ€™s a relevant comment about SMS from&nbsp; [RFC 5724](http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc5724.txt):  
&nbsp;&nbsp;SMS messages very often are delivered almost instantaneously (if the  
&nbsp;&nbsp;receiving SMS client is online), but there is no guarantee for when  
&nbsp;&nbsp;SMS messages will be delivered. &nbsp;In particular, SMS messages between  
&nbsp;&nbsp;different network operators sometimes take a long time to be  
&nbsp;&nbsp;delivered (hours or even days) or are not delivered at all, so  
&nbsp;&nbsp;applications SHOULD NOT make any assumptions about the reliability  
&nbsp;&nbsp;and performance of SMS message transmission.

**Summary:**

Email to SMS will likely work for single messages sent occasionally, but will not work reliably or quickly for high volume critical alerts.
