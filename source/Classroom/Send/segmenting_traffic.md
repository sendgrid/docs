If you are sending more than one type of email to your customers, such as marketing and transactional, it is
often a good idea to seperate the IPs that you send these emails from in order to get better deliverability and
email engagement tracking.

Segmenting by IP Address
{% endanchor %}

One way of segmenting your email sends is to use our <a href="{{site.blog_url}}/sendgrid-announces-new-feature-ip-pooling/">IP Pooling feature</a> to send your different email types
through different IPs. These IPs can be whitelabeled to your domain, so the receiving mail servers have no
questions about who sent the emails.

{% anchor h2 %}
Segmenting by Subuser and IP
{% endanchor %}

You can also segment your email sending by subuser, which will allow you to share the same overall email credit
pool but have unique SMTP credentials, settings, statistics, and site login. Subusers can also be Whitelabeled to separate
sending domains by purchasing additional sending IPs and assigning a subuser to that IP.
