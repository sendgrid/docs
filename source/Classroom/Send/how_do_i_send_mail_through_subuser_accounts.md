All you need to do to send mail through a Subuser account is use that accountâ€™s SMTP credentials to send mail rather than the parent account credentials. Subusers can also log into [sendgrid.com](http://sendgrid.com/) to take advantage of the [SendGrid Email Marketing App](http://sendgrid.com/newsletter/dashboard). Recipient lists and Newsletter templates are unique to each Subuser account.
