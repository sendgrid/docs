The total message size should not exceed&nbsp; **20MB.** This includes the message itself, headers, and the combined size of any attachments.&nbsp;

Using this limit will give you the best chance of not hitting server-side size limits as well, as many mail servers will have varying policies when it comes to the size of messages they will accept.&nbsp;

&nbsp;

This same size limit applies when sending messages to our Parse API webhook, 20mb or under, if you please!
