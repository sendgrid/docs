Content Delivery Networks are a great mechanism that you can use to serve up content very quickly and easily across multiple mediums as well as handle security certificates for you.

We suggest [CloudFlare]({{root_url}}/User_Guide/Setting_Up_Your_Server/content_delivery_networks.html#-Using-CloudFlare), [Fastly]({{root_url}}/User_Guide/Setting_Up_Your_Server/content_delivery_networks.html#-Using-Fastly), or [KeyCDN]({{root_url}}/User_Guide/Setting_Up_Your_Server/content_delivery_networks.html#-Using-KeyCDN) when using Content Delivery Networks with SendGrid.

Using CloudFlare

The following instructions assume you already have a CloudFlare account made, using either a [Full DNS setup](https://support.cloudflare.com/hc/en-us/articles/205195708) or a [CNAME setup](https://support.cloudflare.com/hc/en-us/articles/200168706). You can compare the two different setups [here](https://support.cloudflare.com/hc/en-us/articles/203685674). Note that a CNAME setup is only available to Business or Enterprise level CloudFlare plans.

The instructions also assume that you have set up a valid [branded link](https://sendgrid.com/docs/User_Guide/Settings/Sender_authentication/How_to_set_up_link_branding.html) on your account. This step is essential for the following instructions to work.

Begin by logging into your CloudFlare account, and navigating to the DNS settings for your domain.

![CloudFlare DNS Settings]({{root_url}}/images/cloudflare1.png)

Add a new CNAME entry that points your configured branded link domain to sendgrid.net.

Once the record is created, click on the cloud icon under the Status column to turn it orange and enable HTTP proxy.

Next, navigate to the Page Rules settings for your domain. You will need to create a Page Rule for your branded link domain that sets SSL to Full. This is necessary due to how [CloudFlare validates the certificate on the origin](https://support.cloudflare.com/hc/en-us/articles/200721975). You can find more information on the different SSL options [here](https://support.cloudflare.com/hc/en-us/articles/200170416).

Ensure that the Page Rule is On.

If you are using a CNAME setup, you will also need to change DNS to point to the CloudFlare CNAME you created.

Once all of this is done, you will need to contact [SendGrid support](https://support.sendgrid.com/) and request that SSL click and open tracking be enabled on your account. They will then verify the configuration and enable the setting on your account.

This section is maintained by KeyCDN, if you have any questions about KeyCDN please [contact their support](https://www.keycdn.com/support/) team.

[Sign up for KeyCDN](https://www.keycdn.com) or login to your

Create a pull zone and point the origin URL to https://sendgrid.net.

![KeyCDN Pull Zone]({{root_url}}/images/keycdn1.png)

Enable SSL and HTTP/2 (custom SSL or Let's Encrypt).

![KeyCDN Enable SSL]({{root_url}}/images/keycdn2.png)

Enable the option "Forward Host Header."

![KeyCDN Forward Host Header]({{root_url}}/images/keycdn3.png)

Create a CNAME record in your DNS settings pointing the alias you want to use for your email branded link domain (e.g. email.domain.com) to the Zone URL provided within your KeyCDN dashboard (e.g. sendgrid-1c6b.kxcdn.com). Then, add that alias as a Zonealias.

![KeyCDN Zonealias]({{root_url}}/images/keycdn4.png)

Finally, [contact SendGrid support](https://support.sendgrid.com/hc/en-us), and they'll validate the CDN settings and enable SSL click and open
tracking.
