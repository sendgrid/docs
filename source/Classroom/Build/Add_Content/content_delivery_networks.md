Content Delivery Networks are a great mechanism that you can use to serve up content very quickly and easily across multiple mediums as well as handle security certificates for you.

We suggest [CloudFlare]({{root_url}}/User_Guide/Setting_Up_Your_Server/content_delivery_networks.html#-Using-CloudFlare), [Fastly]({{root_url}}/User_Guide/Setting_Up_Your_Server/content_delivery_networks.html#-Using-Fastly), or [KeyCDN]({{root_url}}/User_Guide/Setting_Up_Your_Server/content_delivery_networks.html#-Using-KeyCDN) when using Content Delivery Networks with SendGrid.

The following instructions assume you already have a CloudFlare account made, using either a [Full DNS setup](https://support.cloudflare.com/hc/en-us/articles/205195708) or a [CNAME setup](https://support.cloudflare.com/hc/en-us/articles/200168706). You can compare the two different setups [here](https://support.cloudflare.com/hc/en-us/articles/203685674). Note that a CNAME setup is only available to Business or Enterprise level CloudFlare plans.

Begin by logging into your CloudFlare account, and navigating to the DNS settings for your domain.

![CloudFlare DNS Settings]({{root_url}}/images/cloudflare1.png)

Add a new CNAME entry that points your configured Email Links WhiteLabel domain to sendgrid.net.

![CloudFlare DNS Addition]({{root_url}}/images/cloudflare2.png)

Once the record is created, click on the cloud icon under the Status column to turn it orange and enable HTTP proxy.

Next, navigate to the Page Rules settings for your domain. You will need to create a Page Rule for your Email Links Whitelabel domain that sets SSL to Full. This is necessary due to how [CloudFlare validates the certificate on the origin](https://support.cloudflare.com/hc/en-us/articles/200721975). You can find more information on the different SSL options [here](https://support.cloudflare.com/hc/en-us/articles/200170416).

Ensure that the Page Rule is On.

If you are using a CNAME setup, you will also need to change DNS to point to the CloudFlare CNAME you created.

Once all of this is done, you will need to contact [SendGrid support](https://support.sendgrid.com/) and request that SSL click and open tracking be enabled on your account. They will then verify the configuration and enable the setting on your account.

[Sign up for Fastly](https://www.fastly.com/signup/) or [log in](https://manage.fastly.com) to your existing account.

Click the CONFIGURE link at the top of the page.

![Fastly Dashboard]({{root_url}}/images/fastly1.png)

![Fastly Service]({{root_url}}/images/fastly2.png)

Fill out the fields as follows:

*Server address and port*: sendgrid.net : 443 (Note the connection on the SSL port 443)

*Domain*: email.example.com (Enter your Email Links WhiteLabel domain here. Ensure it matches the domain configured in the SendGrid whitelabel settings. This value will be what recipients see in your SSL enabled clicktracking links).

*Description*: SendGrid (or whatever you like)

Click the CREATE button. The new service appears in the list of services available.

Fastly has [several options](https://docs.fastly.com/guides/securing-communications/ordering-a-paid-tls-option) for SSL termination. If you want to be able to use your SendGrid link whitelabel domain with SSL, you'll need to select either the Shared Certificate, Shared Wildcard Certificate, or Customer Certificate Hosting options. If you need to add your SendGrid whitelabel domain to your Fastly managed certificate, you can open a support ticket with Fastly by emailing support@fastly.com, and they will walk you through the process. Please put "SSL Certificate Request" in the subject and include your [customer ID](https://docs.fastly.com/guides/account-management-and-security/finding-and-managing-your-account-info#finding-your-customer-id).

After provisioning, update the [CNAME record](https://docs.fastly.com/guides/basic-setup/adding-cname-records) for your domain(s) over to the TLS endpoint provided by Fastly support.

Finally, contact SendGrid support and they'll validate the CDN settings and enable SSL click and open tracking.
