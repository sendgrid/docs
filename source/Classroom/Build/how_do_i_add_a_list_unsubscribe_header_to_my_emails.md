We do it automatically! By simply enabling the [Subscription Tracking](https://app.sendgrid.com/settings/tracking)&nbsp;setting&nbsp;in your account, we'll include a&nbsp;list-unsubscribe header in any messages you send. &nbsp;

For more information about&nbsp;the list-unsubscribe header, and why it is awesome, check out&nbsp;http://www.list-unsubscribe.com/
