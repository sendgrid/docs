 **What is email personalization?**

Email personalization is a deliverability practice that is best described as _adapting bulk messages to an individual subscriber's interest_.&nbsp;Personalization shows that you care about making a connection with your recipients and helps&nbsp;mail seem less like a bulk message and more like a notification. **&nbsp;** Examples of personalization include addressing your subscriber by name, adaptive message content based on website activity, and sending different messages based on subscriber location.&nbsp;

Personalizing message content is beneficial to both senders and recipients in many ways:&nbsp;

-

Subscribers are more likely to interact with messages that are addressed to them specifically, personalized messages are easier to recognize in a cluttered inbox. The more subscribers engage with your mail, the better reputation you will build with ISPs. This translates to better delivery and overall brand trust.&nbsp;

- Personalized emails generate more turn on your investment. When you send messages tailored specifically to each subscriber, you're ensuring you're not wasting credits sending content&nbsp;your recipients aren't interested in receiving.&nbsp;

- When you address your subscribers by name, you're showing ISPs that you care about building a personal relationship with your list rather than sending them bulk mail. When you personalize messages you also avoid phrases such as "Dear sir" that can result in your mail being filtered as spam. This translates to better delivery and overall brand trust.

Personalization is one of the best ways to increase engagement and build a stronger relationship with your subscribers as well as ISPs. Individualized messages are an absolute must if you're trying to get the most out of your email program.&nbsp;
