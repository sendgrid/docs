**I chose to manually pick the winner of my A/B test campaign. Where do I do that?**

You can go into the campaign stats for a campaign anytime after your campaign starts sending to pick the winner.

**I chose to manually pick the winner of my A/B test campaign. How will I know when to do that?**

You’ll get an email on the time-out of your A/B test duration, reminding you to go into the UI and pick your winner. You can also choose the winner at any time within that duration if one variation vastly outperforms the other.

**Can I change the winner method after I’ve started sending my A/B test campaign?**

You cannot change the winner method after your campaign has started sending.

**Can I find out which of my recipients received each variation of my A/B test campaign?**

At this time we do not have that functionality but it is on our roadmap.

**Can I export raw stats for each of my A/B test variations?**

Yes! You can click the “Export CSV” button on the campaign stats page and it will give you a line of stats for each variation (as well as a line for totals) per day.
