A drop occurs when our systems identify that a message is sent to an email address that is already listed on one of the suppression lists: Bounces, Unsubscribes, Spam reports and Invalid Emails. If an email is already on one of the lists mentioned above, our systems automatically drop the email in order to protect your Sender Reputation.

A message that was dropped cannot be resent automatically. However, if the intended recipient of the message that was dropped wishes to receive your content in the future, it is possible remove them from the above mentioned lists, recreate the dropped message, and resend the message to the intended recipients.
