You can receive bounce notifications to a specific address&nbsp;by enabling the "Forward Bounces" feature in your account and&nbsp;defining the forwarding address.&nbsp;

&nbsp;To access this feature navigate to Mail Settings --> Forward Bounce:

[Mail Settings](https://sendgrid.com/beta/settings/mail_settings)

&nbsp;

You'll want to scroll down the page and click the "Enable Bounces Forwarding" box, and leave the email address entry field blank. This setup allows you to receive a bounce notification report to the FROM address on the email that bounced.
