If you want to receive notification of [bounces](http://sendgrid.com/bounces) in your application, you can enable the [Real-time Event Notification API](http://sendgrid.com/docs/API_Reference/Webhooks/event.html) and SendGrid will alert your application of any bounces, clicks, opens, or otherwise that happen to the emails you send.&nbsp;Alternatively, you can enable [Bounce Forwarding](http://sendgrid.com/bounces/bounceManagement) within your account to receive an email each time a bounce occurs.

You can also retrieve and edit your list of bounces through our [Web API.](http://sendgrid.com/docs/API_Reference/Web_API/bounces.html)
