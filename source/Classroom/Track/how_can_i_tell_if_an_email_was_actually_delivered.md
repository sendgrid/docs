There are a couple of ways to tell if an email was actually delivered. You can search in&nbsp;your [Email Activity](https://sendgrid.com/logs/index)&nbsp;which will display delivered mail for the last 7-10 days. If an email is successfully delivered then you will see a delivered event which when expanded will show a reason code of 250 OK. This means the receiving sever has accepted the message. &nbsp;

Email Activity will also show you bounced, deferred and processed messages (click on search options and make sure these are checked).&nbsp;

The 2nd option is to setup a [webhook](https://sendgrid.com/docs/API_Reference/Webhooks/event.html) or the [EventKit](https://sendgrid.com/docs/VidGrid/Event_Notification/eventkit.html). A webhook will show the raw event data on a specified URL. The EventKit has a beautiful and user-friendly UI which will also you search and export results.&nbsp;
