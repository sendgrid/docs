When creating Custom Fields, or uploading a list with customized headers in our Marketing Campaigns features, you may encounter the following error:

![]({{root_url}}/images/Cursor_and_customfeilduniqueerror_png.png)

**This is because you are attempting to use a Custom Field that is already reserved by Sendgrid for internal purposes.**

**These fields, with the exceptions of email, first\_name, and last\_name,&nbsp;can&nbsp;NOT be edited.**

Reserved fields are used to track useful metrics for your contacts by default. Trying to pass additional data into some of these&nbsp;field names can cause inaccuracies in your Contacts.

&nbsp;

Here is a short list of the Reserved Custom Fields:

| **Field Name** | **Field Type** |
| **id** | **text** |
| **first\_name** | **text** |
| **last\_name** | **text** |
| **email** | **text** |
| **created\_at** | **date** |
| **updated\_at** | **date&nbsp;** |
| **last\_emailed** | **date&nbsp;** |
| **last\_clicked** | **date&nbsp;** |
| **last\_opened** | **date&nbsp;** |
