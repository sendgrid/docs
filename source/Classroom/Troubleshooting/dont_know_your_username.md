Your Sendgrid username can be any string of characters that works for you! It can even be in email format if you're comfortable with that.&nbsp;

If you are unsure what your username is, consider checking your existing code or SMTP integration, as your username will probably be in there plain as day.&nbsp;

If you still can't find your username, use the options below to get in touch with support, and we can help you track it down!&nbsp;

SendGrid also allows you to create multiple sets of credentials for your account. You can create a set of credentials for sending mail, website access, API access, or any combination of the three. You can setup and manage credentials&nbsp; [here.](https://app.sendgrid.com/credentials)
