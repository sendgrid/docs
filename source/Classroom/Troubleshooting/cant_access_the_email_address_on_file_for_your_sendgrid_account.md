Sometimes, people leave your company, and their email address gets deleted or lost. Those email accounts can sometimes be&nbsp;associated with important business accounts, like your Sendgrid one! This kind of access is important for notifications, billing alerts, and passwords reset emails. &nbsp;

1. If you find yourself in this kind of situation,&nbsp;use one of the following options to get back in the action.(Recommended) Have your email administrator re-create the email address in question, and then request [password reset](http://support.sendgrid.com/hc/en-us/articles/203893828) email. Sendgrid support can help out if you don't know that the email associated with an account is.
2. You can always [create a new account](https://sendgrid.com/transactional-email/pricing), and sign up with active email you control. Account data cannot be transferred from old to new accounts.&nbsp;
