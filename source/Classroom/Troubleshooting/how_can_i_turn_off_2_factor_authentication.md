Currently there is not a way through the Sendgrid website or API to turn off 2 factor authentication once you've enabled it.&nbsp;

However, a Support agent can turn it off&nbsp;manually upon request, just get in touch using one of the links below to get started!

&nbsp;

We'll need to do a few steps to verify, here's a general rundown:

1. We'll have you verify some information in your account by logging in and making a quick change.&nbsp;

2. We'll send you a text to the number you have registered for 2FA in your account.

3. Once you receive the text, you'll let us know what the text says.

4. If everything checks out, we'll turn it off!
