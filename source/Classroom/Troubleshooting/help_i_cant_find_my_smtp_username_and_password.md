Your SMTP username and password is the same username and password you provided when you signed up for SendGrid. We use the same set of credentials for the website access and SMTP authentication.

&nbsp;

SendGrid also allows you to create multiple sets of credentials for your account. You can create a set of credentials for sending mail, website access, API access, or any combination of the three. You can setup and manage credentials here:
