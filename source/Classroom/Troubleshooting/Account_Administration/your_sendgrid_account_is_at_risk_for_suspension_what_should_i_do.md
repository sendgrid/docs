When you get an email like this, it means that our system noticed that your deliverability rates &nbsp;(delivered events / processed events) have dropped, or that you received complaints (spam reports) from you clients.

Don't worry though, this&nbsp;is simply a precautionary warning. No need to be alarmed!

&nbsp;

**What should you do?**

- **Check your email activity:** You should take a close look at your recent email activity logs by using the [Stats Dashboard](https://sendgrid.com/statistics/overview). There, you would have to check your Bounce / Spam Report / Invalid Email Rates. All of these could affect your reputation as a sender.

- **How to resolve the problem:**

  - **Remove the bounces / spam reports / invalid emails from your mailing lists** : It is important that you remove these kind of addresses, to avoid sending emails to them again, and further damage your reputation. A nifty tool that can help you a lot with this is [List Assist](https://sendgrid.com/docs/Utilities/list_assist.html). A video tutorial of the List Assist tool can be found [here](https://sendgrid.com/docs/VidGrid/Tools/listassist.html).
  - **Monitor your stats:** check your email activity stats regularly, making sure that you do not get bounces / spam reports events at all. When you do see such an event, make sure that you check out the [Email Activity](https://sendgrid.com/logs/index) page, and see exactly what went wrong with specific emails. Setting up a Stats Notification alert from your [Alert Settings](https://sendgrid.com/alerts) page of your account can save you a lot of trouble, as we can automatically provide you details about your email activity at your desired frequency, via email.

<font style="font-size: 14pt;" size="4"><strong>Do we have any kind of threshold at which the accounts get suspended?</strong></font>

Although some settings have been made in our server for this, we cannot disclose that information as it is part of our secret sauce.

<font style="font-size: 14pt;" size="4"><strong>I did all the things that have been asked from me, but I still got suspended.</strong></font>

In this situation you most probably received an email already from our Compliance & Abuse team. Please reply to that email in order to get in touch with them and have things cleared out, and re-activate your account. More information about suspended accounts can be found [here]({{root_url}}/Classroom/Troubleshooting/Account_Administration/account_under_review_suspended.html).

Happy sending!
