Your SMTP username and password is the same username and password you provided when you signed up for SendGrid. We use the same set of credentials as the default means of logging into the Customer Portal and SMTP authentication.

SendGrid also allows account owners to invite multiple [teammates]({{root_url}}/User_Guide/Settings/teammates.html), or individual users of the same account, with their own login credentials.

Click [here]({{root_url}}/Classroom/Troubleshooting/Account_Administration/recovering_your_username.html) to learn more about how to recover your username.

Click [here]({{root_url}}/Classroom/Basics/Account/how_do_i_reset_my_password.html) to learn how to reset your password.

If you are integrating with SendGrid's Web API v3, we highly recommend that you only use [API Keys]({{root_url}}/Classroom/Basics/API/api_key_permissions.html) when [authenticating]({{root_url}}/API_Reference/Web_API_v3/How_To_Use_The_Web_API_v3/authentication.html).
