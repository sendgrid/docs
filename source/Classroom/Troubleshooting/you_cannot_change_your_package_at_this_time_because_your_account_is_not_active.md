Trying to upgrade and seeing this message? There are a couple of reasons you might see this.&nbsp;

&nbsp;

**Outstanding payment** - You may have an outstanding balance remaining on your account. We prevent accounts from upgrading further until these kind of issues are cleared up. Be sure to check your [Billing History](https://sendgrid.com/billing) to see if any invoices are unpaid. If this is the case, you can [resubmit payment](http://support.sendgrid.com/hc/en-us/articles/200183078-Update-your-Credit-Card-Resubmit-Payments) directly from the site.&nbsp;

&nbsp;

**Account Suspension** - Our compliance team may have your account under review, this status also prevents further upgrading until everything has been resolved. [Read more here](http://support.sendgrid.com/hc/en-us/articles/200182918-Account-Under-Review-Suspended) about what to do in this case.
