## Starting your Telnet connection

To begin, open your Windows menu, type cmd into the search function, and press enter.&nbsp;

If you are using a Mac, launch the Terminal application.&nbsp;

You should now be looking at a DOS-prompt style window with a blinking cursor in the top left-hand corner, you will use this window to input the commands to initiate a telnet connection. Use the&nbsp;progression&nbsp;below to walk you through the connection, every line starting with > is a command you will type and&nbsp;subsequently&nbsp;press the <enter> key afterwards.&nbsp;

## Acceptable Ports

We accept unencrypted and TLS connections on ports **25** , **587** , & **2525** &nbsp;and&nbsp;SSL encryption on **465**.  
You can test for open ports using the following telnet command, substituting _#_ for a port number:

    >telnet smtp.sendgrid.net #

&nbsp;

## Telnet Response:

    >telnet smtp.sendgrid.net # <enter>220 xxxx ESMTP service ready>EHLO <enter>250-xxxx250-8BITMIME250-SIZE 20480000250-AUTH=PLAIN LOGIN250-AUTH PLAIN LOGIN250 STARTTLS>auth login <enter>334 VXNlcm5hbWU6>your BASE64 encoded SG username <enter>334 UGFzc3dvcmQ6>your BASE64 encoded SG password <enter>235 Authentication successful. ***

**_\*\*\* This indicates that your connection to smtp.sendgrid.net over the selected port is open, and your username and password are valid as authentication credentials._**

_ **Note** :&nbsp;__If upon attempting 'telnet smtp.sendgrid.net #', you receive an error stating "'telnet' is not recognized as an internal or external command, operable program or batch file." this means that Telnet is not installed on your machine. This can be done by visiting your "Add and Remove Progams" section within your Control Panel, and installing the 'Telnet Client' and 'Telnet Server' packages within 'Turn&nbsp;Windows&nbsp;features on or off".&nbsp;_
