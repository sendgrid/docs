In your logs, you may be seeing Deferral events with the reason(s) of;

**Email was deferred due to the following reason(s): [IPs reached ISP-suggested max connection limits]({{root_url}}/Classroom/Troubleshooting/Delivery_Issues/email_was_deferred_due_to_the_following_reasons_ip_deferrals_messages.html)**

**What's that about?** I'm glad you asked. We've recently updated the infrastructure that handles the actual sending of mail off to it's intended recipients, specifically updated in regards to sending rate. 

**So what's wrong with my IPs?**  Nothing! This is simply due to the fact that most of the time we are sending mail _way_ faster than most ISPs can accept it. Rather than turning the fire hose on full-blast, we create one of these deferral events to control the rate of delivery by ISP to help prevent throttling and spam folder delivery. Sending too much mail too fast is a great way to get on an ISP's naughty list.  

We spend a lot of time tuning the rate of delivery on an ISP by ISP basis, and these deferral events are simply proof that this system is working for you to keep ISPs happy with your throughput, regardless of your sending habits.

**Cool, so is there anything I need to do?**  Nope, we'll continue to attempt delivery of Deferred messages for up to 72 hours, after which time we may [drop the message]({{root_url}}/Classroom/Deliver/Undeliverable_Email/my_emails_are_being_dropped.html) if the ISP still isn't able accept the messages. These deferrals may sometimes result in delays between an email's Processed event and the eventual Delivery event, but again, this is simply us optimizing the rate at which email sends are attempted. 

 

**Email was deferred due to the following reason(s): [IPs reached ISP-suggested max connection limits]({{root_url}}/Classroom/Troubleshooting/Delivery_Issues/email_was_deferred_due_to_the_following_reasons_ip_deferrals_messages.html)** 

SendGrid can automatically warmup dedicated IP addresses by limiting the amount of mail that can be sent through them per hour, with the limit determined by how long the IP address has been in warmup. See the [warmup schedule]({{root_url}}/API_Reference/Web_API_v3/IP_Management/ip_warmup_schedule.html) for more details.

If you have existing warm IPs as well as new IPs that need warming, any mail beyond the hourly maximum limit will overflow to your existing warm IPs.

If there are no existing warm IPs, any requests made above the hourly maximum limit will overflow to our Shared IP Warmup clusters for sending. If your sending reputation is below 85, you will not be able to use these Shared IP Warmup clusters.

An IP in warmup will always follow SendGridâ€™s Warmup Schedule. Please consider a measured approach when sending on a new IP to allow for proper IP warmup. You can read more on [the importance of warming up a new IP]({{root_url}}/User_Guide/warming_up.html) and consider your sending volume for best deliverability.
