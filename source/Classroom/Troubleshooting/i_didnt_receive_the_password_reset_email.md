There are a few things to take into account when requesting a password reset;

1. Make sure&nbsp;you are putting in your username and not your email address in the password reset screen.

2. Make sure&nbsp;you are expecting the email at the correct address. The password reset will be sent to email you have in your SendGrid Account settings.&nbsp;

3. It is possible that you cannot login because the bililng dept has terminated your account due to non-payment. In that case you should have received several emails detailing this and again these emails are going to the&nbsp;email you have in your SendGrid Account settings.&nbsp;

4. The email may be in your SPAM or Junk folder. Be sure to check there, and if you do find it there, mark it as "not spam".

**For security reasons, Sendgrid Support agents cannot change account passwords. Sorry about that!&nbsp;**
