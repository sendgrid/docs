Some DNS providers do not support underscores in zone file entries, however an underscore is required in the DKIM TXT entries outlined in the  [Whitelabel Wizard](http://docs.sendgrid.com/documentation/get-started/whitelabel-wizard/).

If your provider does not allow you to use underscores, you need to consider changing DNS hosting providers if you want to take advantage of the Whitelabel feature.
