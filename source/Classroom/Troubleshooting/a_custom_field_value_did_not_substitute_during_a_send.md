First, check to make sure there is a value associated with the contact in your contact database. If there is no value for a particular Custom Field, a space will be substituted instead.

You can search for a specific email address in your "All Contacts" section and go to their contact profile to check the value of a custom field. Otherwise, check the spelling of the substitution tag in the content of your campaign.
