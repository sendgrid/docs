Each template you create will have a grouping of versions for this template. This allows you to see where you’ve been and create new versions without using them until you make them active. Only one version can be active per template.

As you create new templates, you may find that a list view might be more suitable to scrolling through your templates. To switch the view, find the view options next to the “Create Template” button and select the list or box view option.

From the main template view on each template group, you will see a gear icon menu. From this menu, you can choose to edit 
the name of your template, [add a version]({{root_url}}/User_Guide/Templates/create_edit.html), or delete the template.

To delete a template, you must first delete all the versions of your template.
