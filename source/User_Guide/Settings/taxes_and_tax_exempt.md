SendGrid now collects sales tax in 6 jurisdictions: Denver Colorado, Boulder Colorado, Chicago Illinois, Washington state, New York state, and Texas. We assign tax jurisdiction by the billing address you have in our system. If your billing address is in one of these jurisdictions, and you don't have 501(c)(3) tax-exempt status, you will see a line for sales tax [on your invoice]({{root_url}}/User_Guide/Settings/reading_your_invoice.html). For more information about declaring your tax-exempt status, see [Declaring tax-exempt status](#-Declaring-tax-exempt-status).

Tax FAQ
{% endanchor %}

{% anchor h3 %}
Why does SendGrid collect sales tax?
{% endanchor %}

If SendGrid has a physical presence in a jurisdiction, and we directly sell a taxable product to someone located in that jurisdiction, then we are required to collect sales tax on behalf of that jurisdiction.

{% anchor h3 %}
Who is required to pay sales tax?
{% endanchor %}

SendGrid collects sales tax in the following jurisdictions:

- Denver, Colorado
- Boulder, Colorado
- Chicago, Illinois
- Washington state
- New York state
- Texas

To determine whether to add sales tax to your monthly SendGrid bill, we use the address you enter as your billing address in [Settings | Plan & Billing Details](https://app.sendgrid.com/settings/billing) in the SendGrid UI.

{% anchor h3 %}
Where can I see how much I am getting charged for sales tax each month?
{% endanchor %}

If you are being charged sales tax, you will see it as a line item on your invoice. Youâ€™ll be able to find the new sales tax line item by navigating to [Settings | Plan & Billing Details](https://app.sendgrid.com/settings/billing) in the SendGrid UI, then by viewing your invoice, which is in PDF form.

{% anchor h3 %}
Can I get an estimate of my sales tax?
{% endanchor %}

Unfortunately, we cannot provide estimates of sales tax for an individual customer ahead of time. The taxes assessed could change monthly for various reasons such as state or local tax laws changing. You can check your bill throughout the month for an estimate of your sales tax.

{% anchor h3 %}
Will my tax amount vary from month to month?
{% endanchor %}

Taxes charged can vary month-to-month based on local tax laws changing, or if your product mix causes your bill to be greater or less than in previous months.

{% anchor h3 %}
How does SendGrid calculate the sales tax owed?
{% endanchor %}

Tax laws change regularly, so we work with a third party software that focuses on deeply understanding local and state tax laws. SendGrid uses this software to calculate the sales tax you are charged each month.
