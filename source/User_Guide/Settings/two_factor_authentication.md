What is Two-Factor Authentication?
{% endanchor %}

Two-factor authentication, commonly referred to as multi-factor authentication, allows you to make your SendGrid account more secure by requiring authentication beyond a simple username and password when logging in.

SendGrid’s Two-Factor Authentication can be configured to accept a code sent to your mobile phone either via the the [Authy App](https://www.authy.com/app/mobile/), or an SMS message.

How To Set Up Two-Factor Authentication
{% endanchor %}

You may choose from two different verification methods when using two-factor authentication:

1. Generating a verification code in the [Authy App](https://www.authy.com/app/mobile/).
2. Entering a code sent to your mobile phone that is generated by SendGrid.

        The Authy App allows you to authenticate over WiFi if you do not have cellular service. However, you may still resort to an SMS message as a backup if you decide to use Authy.

To set up Two-Factor Authentication, navigate to your **Settings**, and click **Two-Factor Authentication**. From this page, you will be able to see an overview of your Two-Factor Authentication settings, along with any settings that you have created for Credentialed Users.

To add a new Two-Factor Authentication setting, click **Add Two-Factor Authentication**.

You will then be presented with a window allowing you to select either the Authy App or text messages (SMS) as your means of authentication.

If you select the Authy App, you will then need to enter your **country code** and **phone number**.

After clicking Next, you will be sent a message with information on how to install the Authy App. The phone number that you provide will also be used as your backup means of authentication if you run into problems with the Authy App.

Once you have installed the Authy App, you will be given a **7-digit token**. Enter this token and click save.

After you have installed the Authy App and entered the 7-digit token, your new Two-Factor Authentication setting is verified and ready for use.

You may back out of the setup process at any time without fear of locking yourself out of your account. We will create an entry labeled “Not Verified”, allowing you to delete the setting without consequence, or verify it for future use.

Using Two-Factor Authentication
{% endanchor %}

After you have created a setting for Two-Factor Authentication, simply log in as you normally would. If you have selected to receive a text message with your authentication token, look for the text message and enter the code that you receive. If you have selected the Authy App, go to your app, and enter the generated code.

Once setup, you will always be required to use Two-Factor Authentication to perform security-restricted actions in your SendGrid account, such as logging in or changing your Two-Factor Authentication settings. When prompted, simply enter the 7-digit token sent to your device, or generated by the Authy App.
