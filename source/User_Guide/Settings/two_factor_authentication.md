{% info %}
Multifactor authentication applies to website logins. It does not change
how credentials are used to send email.

{% info %}
If you have 2FA enabled on your account, [Multiple User Credentials]({{root_url}}/User_Guide/Settings/multiple_credentials.html) logins will trigger a 2FA notification to the main credential's phone number.
