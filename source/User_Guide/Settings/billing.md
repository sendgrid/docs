When you create or upgrade to a paid account, you will put a credit card in for automatic payments. This will allow SendGrid to make the recurring package charges for your account without having to notify you each month of the bill. SendGrid relies on a PCI-DSS compliant 3rd party billing provider to store, process, and manage payment card processing.
