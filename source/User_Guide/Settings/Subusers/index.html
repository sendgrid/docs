{% info %}
If you have a **Pro plan or higher**, you may create up to 15 subusers through your account. If you reach the maximum of 15 and require more subusers, please use the form in the <a href="https://app.sendgrid.com/settings/subusers">Subuser Management</a> page to request more.
{% endinfo %}

Subusers are SendGrid accounts that belong to a parent account. They have their own permissions and credit limits, which you assign as you create the subusers. Subusers are provided in order to help you segment your email sending and API activity. We suggest our customers create subusers for each of the different types of emails they send. This often means one subuser for transactional emails and one for marketing emails; however some of our customers will break up their sending across multiple subusers in order to segment the statistics for each type or function of email they send.

Manage Subusers
{% endanchor %}

Subusers can be managed via <a href="https://sendgrid.api-docs.io/v3.0/subuser-api">Subuser API</a> or by logging into your SendGrid account under Settings > Subuser Management.

To manage a Subuser, click the name of the Subuser. This will take you to the Subuser’s account and profile settings. From there, you can manage and update your Subuser Settings.

Create a Subuser
{% endanchor %}

When your account is created with SendGrid, you do not have any subusers initially.

To create a subuser, first visit <a href="https://app.sendgrid.com/settings/subusers">Settings > Subuser Management</a>, then click the “Create New Subuser” button at the top of the page.

When you’re done entering information, click the blue “Create Subuser” button at the top of the subuser window. You will be taken to the subuser’s profile page.

{% info %}
You can have 15 subusers. If you need more, please contact <a href="{{site.support_url}}">SendGrid support</a>.
{% endinfo %}

<strong>Username</strong> - The username your subuser will use to send email and access the API.

<strong>Email Address</strong> - The contact email address for this subuser. This must be an active email account as SendGrid may contact a subuser to provide support, resolve sending and deliverability issues, or to enforce SendGrid's Terms of Service. Whenever we contact a subuser, it is our policy to contact the parent account email address at the same time.

<strong>Password</strong> - The password your subuser will use to access SendGrid.com.

<strong>Confirm Password</strong> - Confirm the password above was typed correctly.

<strong>Avatar</strong> - A <a href="http://gravatar.com">gravatar</a> will load when an email address is entered, making it easier to identify your subusers in the subuser list.

{% warning %}
One email credit will be charged for every monitor email that is sent.
{% endwarning %}

<strong>Email Monitor</strong> - By default, this feature is off. To turn it on, click the “off” button. You will be shown a form that allows you to set the frequency that SendGrid will test emails and the address to which these emails will be forwarded.

The “Collect Sample Rate” is the number of emails SendGrid will allow your account to send before copying the email address you set on the next email sent. For example, if you set the collect sample rate at 100, then you will receive a copy of every 100th email this subuser sends.

{% info %}
Keep in mind that the subusers assigned to an IP address will effect the sending reputation of that IP address. This can include both the parent account and other subuser accounts assigned to that IP. All account plans below Pro 100k share an IP address with other users on the same account level. Upgrading to Pro 100k plan or higher includes a dedicated IP address. This means that your account and subusers sending practices alone effect the sending reputation of the IP addresses assigned to your account.
{% endinfo %}

<strong>IP Addresses</strong>

When you create a SendGrid account and select a Pro plan or higher, your account is assigned to a dedicated IP address. All of your mail sent through SendGrid will show as originating from this IP address, unless you have purchased additional IPs and assigned IP addresses to them or set up <a href="{{root_url}}/API_Reference/Web_API_v3/IP_Management/ip_pools.html">IP Pools</a>.

We give you the same functionality when you create your subusers. Simply select the IP address you would like this subuser to send from. We will show you which other users are assigned to the same IP address, so you can keep similar senders together.

If you need more IP addresses, please contact <a href="{{site.support_url}}">SendGrid support</a>.

If you would like to see how your subusers are performing in comparison to each other, simply click on the “Export” button on the <a href="https://app.sendgrid.com/settings/subusers">main subuser page</a>. This will create a CSV file that will have each subuser’s reputation, number of requests each subuser made this month, and the number of requests each subuser made last month.
