If you are sending email through SendGrid and have the [Subscription Tracking Setting]({{root_url}}/User_Guide/Settings/tracking.html) turned on, an unsubscribe option will be added to the footer of every email that gets sent through your account. A user who clicks the unsubscribe link will be added to your [global unsubscribe list]({{site.app_url}}/suppressions/global_unsubscribes) and **any** future attempts to send email to those users will be suppressed unless theyâ€™re removed. You can also manage this list manually, adding and removing addresses via the UI or with the use of [API calls]({{root_url}}/API_Reference/Web_API/unsubscribes.html).

The [Subscription Tracking Setting]({{root_url}}/User_Guide/Settings/tracking.html) also has a number of options for customization, such as a replacement tag that allows you to place the unsubscribe text somewhere in the body of the email, the ability to reword the unsubscribe message, and the ability to add a custom landing page.
