<p>Transactional Emails are emails that are typically related to system and account related activity. A common example of these types of emails
are Password emails, system notifications, and email verification messages.</p>
<p>
The parts of a Transactional Email are:
</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Headers</strong> - The information that tells email servers how to route emails, who they are for, and what to do with them.</li>
    <li><strong>Content</strong> - The actual information that the customer sees within the email.</li>
    <li><strong>Template</strong> - The "pretty" part of the email, everything that is not content that the user sees.</li>
</ul>
