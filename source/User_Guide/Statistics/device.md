The top 5 section will show you the most engaged email clients and devices based on the selected metric. By default, clicks are select, but you can change that by choosing a metric from the button at the top of this section. You can change which metrics, date, or grouping by adjusting the [statistics filters]({{root_url}}/User_Guide/Statistics/index.html#-Statistics-Filters).

Based on the selected devices and metric at the top of this page, this graph will refresh. You can see how your recipients engage with your emails by device type over time.
