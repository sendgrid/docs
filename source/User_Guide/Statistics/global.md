{% info %}
Global stats shown are not an aggregate total for parent accounts and subusers. The stats outlined will only contain data for whichever account you are currently accessing. Subuser stats can, however, be accessed from the Parent account's Stats menu either on an individual basis, or by comparing multiple subusers.
{% endinfo %}

Your Global Stats page is where you can really dig into your email stats. From here you will be able to filter through your stats by type, but you will also be able to look at the actual numbers for each stat by date. You can change which metrics, date, or grouping by adjusting the [statistics filters]({{root_url}}/User_Guide/Statistics/index.html#-Statistics-Filters).

Figures
{% endanchor %}

The figures table gives you all of the specific counts or percentages of each event, according to how youâ€™ve grouped your stats (day, week, or month). For example, if you wanted to see what percentage of the emails you sent were actually opened on the 2nd week of April, this is a great place to check.

This table will refresh with new or adjusted data based on the various filters available at the top of the page. You can also choose to show actual counts or percentages, by clicking the corresponding button above and to the right of the table.
