The Parse Webhook will accept emails on your behalf, parse them, and send them where you want them to go. We provide you with statistics about how many emails SendGrid is parsing for you over time. You can control the graph by adjusting the [statistics filters]({{root_url}}/User_Guide/Statistics/index.html#-Statistics-Filters).
