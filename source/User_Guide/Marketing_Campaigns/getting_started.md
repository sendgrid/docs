The Code Editor provides users who are importing, editing, or crafting custom HTML a robust environment to upload images, write HTML, and configure their campaign without interference from the HTML generating WYSIWYG tools. 

The Design Editor offers users powerful drag & drop WYSIWYG editing tools making it possible for anyone to build beautiful emails, regardless of HTML knowledge. For those familiar with HTML looking to leverage the design editor you can modify the HTML of individual content modules.
