Set Notifications

If you would like to have notifications sent to an email other than your parent account address, you can opt in to receive email notifications from SendGrid about your account's marketing campaigns activity.  Email notifications about CSV upload summaries, sender verifications, A/B test winner notifications, and list/segment exports can be sent to up to 10 different email addresses. Simply click "Add New Email" and enter an email address in the modal window that pops up.
