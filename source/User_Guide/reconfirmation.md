What is a Reconfirmation Campaign? 
{% endanchor %}

In order to maximize your email deliverability it is important to keep
your address list current and clean. A reconfirmation email, otherwise
known as a re-opt in email, reminds clients you correspond with about
your business (which can increase your inbound marketing), effectively
cleans your lists with minimal impact to your deliverability, and
prevents inadvertently spamming your clients.

Why Reconfirm? 
{% endanchor %}

As you opt-in your recipients, the email addresses provided to you
initially may become obsolete. These addresses might become abandoned
and eventually recycled or converted to spam traps. Or your recipients
might simply become disinterested in receiving your emails.

This can cause problems for your email deliverability. Old addresses 
become undeliverable and subsequent sending will result in bounces.
Recipients that have become disinterested are more likely to mark 
your mail as spam, especially if there is no easy opt-out method in the email.

To prevent these problems, we recommend using re opt-in messages. 
These emails remind your recipients of your services they once opted 
in, and politely ask for the recipient's permission to continue sending 
emails.

How to Reconfirm 
{% endanchor %}

Send an email with two links: one link to re-opt in the recipient, 
and the other link to opt-out the recipient. If they do not 
explicitly opt back in with this email, their address should be 
removed from your list as this is an indication your recipient is not 
engaging in your emails. This could be a sign that you are sending to 
someone that does not care for your emails, or even worse, you could 
be sending to a spam trap.

If you are set up with SendGrid's Event API, click and open events are 
an excellent way to track which of your users have been unengaged and 
might be the best targets for your reconfirmation emails. You can even 
make your reconfirmation emails specific to a particular segmented list 
if your address lists are set up in this fashion.

This approach is much more favorable than trying to clean a large old 
address list all at once. Sending to a 10-year-old list (or even a 
3-month-old list) can produce a high bounce rate and cause your 
unengaged recipients to mark your emails as spam. Email service 
providers discourage this type of sending because of these results. 
Keep in mind, the older the list, the bigger the headache it will be to clean.

How Often Should We Reconfirm? 
{% endanchor %}

We recommend sending re opt-in messages to recipients if you haven't 
corresponded with or otherwise interacted with via email in over **3 
months**. This may seem like a short duration, however, you might be 
surprised with how quickly your recipients can lose interest in your 
emails. Of course there are many types of businesses and this 
recommendation of 3 months is only a suggestion. 

Ultimately, the more frequently you clean your address list, the less 
likely you will be to have deliverability problems related to old lists.
