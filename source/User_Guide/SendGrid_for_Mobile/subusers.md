{% warning %}
This view will only be available in the app if you are on a Silver or higher plan and have created one or more subusers.
{% endwarning %}

Here you can view your current subusers and also “impersonate” them, allowing you to view the app as though you logged in as that subuser.

{% info %}
The app currently only displays a maximum of 10 subusers. If you have more than 10 subusers, you can pull down and search for the username of a specific subuser that is not listed.
{% endinfo %}

Once you tap on a subuser, you’ll be presented with a summary of the account’s performance. You can then tap the “Impersonate User” button to “log in” as that subuser, and view the app as that subuser. When impersonating a subuser, you’ll find a “Logged in as [subuser name]” banner along the top of the app. You’ll also notice that the “Subuser Management” option in the side navigation menu changes to “Log Into Parent Account,” which you can use to switch back to your main parent account.
