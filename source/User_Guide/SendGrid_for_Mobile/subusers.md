{% warning %}
This view will only be available in the app if you are on a Pro 100k or higher plan and have created one or more subusers.
{% endwarning %}

Here you can view your current subusers and also “impersonate” them, allowing you to view the app as though you logged in as that subuser.

{% info %}
The app currently only displays a maximum of 10 subusers. If you have more than 10 subusers, you can pull down and search for the username of a specific subuser that is not listed.
{% endinfo %}

Once you select a subuser, you’ll be presented with a summary of the account’s performance. You can then click the “Impersonate User” button to log in as that subuser and view their apps. When impersonating a subuser, you’ll find a message in the banner at the top of the page that says “You’re currently logged in as [subuser name].” You can switch back to your parent account by clicking the “Back to Parent Account” link on the left side of the banner at the top of the SendGrid UI.
