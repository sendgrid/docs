A group unsubscribe happens when a recipient indicates that they would like to opt out from a specific type of email that you send via the [Unsubscribe Groups link]({{root_url}}/User_Guide/Suppressions/group_unsubscribes.html#-Group-Unsubscribe-Substitution-Tag) from within your email. The list provided here can be filtered by email address or date.

In the top right corner, you will see a calendar icon. Click this and choose the unsubscribe dates you would like to search between. Your recipient list will refresh, showing the recipients who unsubscribed between these dates.

{% anchor h2 %}
Download Group Unsubscribes as CSV
{% endanchor %}

You can download your Group Unsubscribe list as a CSV by clicking the gear icon at the top of the page and selecting “Download CSV”. The file will download in your browser right away.

{% anchor h2 %}
Removing Recipients From The List
{% endanchor %}

When you select the checkboxes next to the recipient names or select all, using the checkbox next to the search box, you will see a new button at the top of the page. From this list, you can choose to remove the selected recipients from the list.

{% anchor h3 %}
Group Unsubscribe Substitution Tag
{% endanchor %}

When you add the `<%asm_group_unsubscribe_url%>` tag to your email, we will replace that tag with the text "Unsubscribe From This List", wherever the tag is found in your email. This link will allow your recipients to unsubscribe from the [unsubscribe group]({{root_url}}/User_Guide/Suppressions/group_unsubscribes.html) that you attached to this email.

Alternatively, you can use the `<%asm_group_unsubscribe_raw_url%>` tag which will be replaced with only the group unsubscribe URL without the hyperlinked text "Unsubscribe From This List".

For more substitution tags, please see our [transactional templates]({{root_url}}/User_Guide/Transactional_Templates/create_and_edit_transactional_templates.html#-Adding-unsubscribe-links-to-a-template).
