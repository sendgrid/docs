Global unsubscribes happen when a recipient indicates that they would like to opt out from any email that you send by clicking on the [Unsubscribe From All Emails link]({{root_url}}/User_Guide/Suppressions/global_unsubscribes.html#-Global-Unsubscribe-Substitution-Tags) within your emails. The list provided here can be filtered by email address or date.

When you select the checkboxes next to the recipient names or select all, using the checkbox next to the search box, you will see a new button at the top of the page. From this list, you can choose to remove the selected recipients from the list.

Global Unsubscribe Substitution Tag
{% endanchor %}


When you add the `<%asm_global_unsubscribe_url%>` tag to your email, we will replace that tag with the text "Unsubscribe From All Emails", wherever the tag is found in your email. This will allow your recipient to be [globally unsubscribed]({{root_url}}/User_Guide/Suppressions/global_unsubscribes.html) from all of your emails.

Alternatively, you can use the `<%asm_global_unsubscribe_raw_url%>` tag, which will be replaced with only the global unsubscribe URL without the hyperlinked text "Unsubscribe From All Emails".

For more substitution tags, please see our [transactional templates]({{root_url}}/User_Guide/Transactional_Templates/create_and_edit_transactional_templates.html#-Adding-unsubscribe-links-to-a-template).
