The Suppression Lists section will allow you to view and modify your accountâ€™s [suppression lists]({{root_url}}/Delivery_Metrics/email_reports.html).

Depending on the list you're viewing, you can tap on an address to get more information (for instance, the bounce reason for addresses listed on the bounce list).  You can also swipe left on an address to delete it off a list.

If you're viewing the Unsubscribe list, you can hit the "+" button to manually add an address to the list.

Finally, if you want to search for a specific address, pull downwards on the list and type an address in the search field.
