The dashboard page will display your accountâ€™s statistics for the past day, week, or month. SendGrid offers a number of [Delivery Metrics]({{root_url}}/Delivery_Metrics/index.html) to report what is happening with your messages.

You can also export the statistics for each individual day to a CSV file by tapping the Share button.
