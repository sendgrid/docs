Moving from Legacy Newsletter to Marketing Campaigns
{% endanchor %}

The migration to Marketing Campaigns is not automatic. We’ve built a [robust toolkit]({{root_url}}/User_Guide/Legacy_Newsletter/index.html) to help make the manual migration steps fast and simple. This high-level checklist is part of the toolkit and is designed to help you think through important considerations as you make the move to Marketing Campaigns.

{% anchor h3 %}
1. Familiarize yourself with Marketing Campaigns.
{% endanchor %}

&nbsp; &#x274f; Review the comprehensive [side-by-side comparison]({{root_url}}/User_Guide/Legacy_Newsletter/Side_by_Side_Comparisons/index.html) of Legacy Newsletter vs. Marketing Campaigns.

&nbsp; &#x274f; Watch [this video]({{root_url}}/User_Guide/Legacy_Newsletter/index.html) for an introduction to Marketing Campaigns.

&nbsp; &#x274f; Learn about Marketing Campaigns [segmentation capabilities]({{root_url}}/User_Guide/Marketing_Campaigns/lists.html).

&nbsp; &#x274f; Learn about Marketing Campaigns' new and improved [campaign building workflow and editor]({{root_url}}/User_Guide/Legacy_Newsletter/Side_by_Side_Comparisons/campaign_building.html).

&nbsp; &#x274f; Practice by creating a test campaign and sending it to yourself.

{% anchor h3 %}
2. Choose how you'd like to pay.
{% endanchor %}

&nbsp; &#x274f; If you used Legacy Newsletter between 1 August 2016 and 30 March 2017, when you switch to Marketing Campaigns, you can choose how you’d like to pay. **The ability to choose/switch how you pay is available until January 31, 2018 at which point you'll be locked into whichever pricing option you've selected.** You can continue to pay per email sent or you can choose to pay per contact you store in Marketing Campaigns.

&nbsp; &#x274f; Estimate your per-email vs. per-contact cost using [the Marketing Campaigns pricing page]( https://app.sendgrid.com/settings/choose_how_you_pay). If that link does not work for you, log into the app, navigate to **Settings** then **Plan and Billing Details**, then scroll to Marketing Campaigns and click **Learn More**.

{% anchor h3 %}
3. Migrate your contacts.
{% endanchor %}

&nbsp; &#x274f; Consider which of your contact lists you'd like to migrate. You may wish to use this opportunity to remove old or non-responsive contacts.

&nbsp; &#x274f; Consider how you might segment your contacts and send more targeted, relevant campaigns.

&nbsp; &#x274f; If in use, replace the Legacy Subscription Widget with one of the best-in-class [email list growth integrations for Marketing Campaigns]({{root_url}}/User_Guide/Legacy_Newsletter/Migration_Tutorials/migrating_recipient_lists.html#-Replacing-the-Legacy-Newsletter-Subscription-Widget).

&nbsp; &#x274f; Review the [Contact Migration Guide]({{root_url}}/User_Guide/Legacy_Newsletter/Migration_Tutorials/migrating_recipient_lists.html) for step-by-step instructions for moving your contacts into Marketing Campaigns.

&nbsp; &#x274f; <b style="color:red">IMPORTANT!</b> You may have invalid or unsubscribed emails. If you do, ensure you migrate them. Review [Migrating Your Unsubscribes]({{root_url}}/User_Guide/Legacy_Newsletter/Migration_Tutorials/migrating_unsubscribes.html) for detailed instructions.
