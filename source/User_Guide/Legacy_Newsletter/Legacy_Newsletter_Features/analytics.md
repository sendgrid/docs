Starting from your newsletter dashboard, you’ll see your global newsletter stats. This graph is showing how all of your newsletters are being received by all of your recipient lists. It’s a global view of all of the sending that you’ve done through this application.

To see the stats from a specific newsletter, select this button ![Email Marketing Stats]({{root_url}}/images/EmailMarketing_Analytics_1.png) on the right-hand side, and choose the desired newsletter.

Here, you’ll have access to:

* [Bounces / Repeat Bounces]({{root_url}}/Glossary/bounces.html)
* [Clicks / Unique Clicks / Click-through rate]({{root_url}}/Glossary/clicks.html)
* [Deliveries]({{root_url}}/Glossary/deliveries.html)
* [Invalid emails]({{root_url}}/User_Guide/Suppressions/invalid_emails.html)
* [Opens / Unique Opens]({{root_url}}/Glossary/opens.html)
* [Requests]({{root_url}}/Glossary/request.html)
* [Spam reports / Repeat spam reports]({{root_url}}/Glossary/spam_reports.html)
* [Unsubscribes]({{root_url}}/User_Guide/Email_Deliverability/Subscription_Tracking/index.html)

You can learn more about each of these statistics [here]({{root_url}}/User_Guide/Delivery_Metrics/metrics.html).

You can also view the statistics for your newsletters by going to [Marketing Email > Manage]({{site.marketing_email_url}}/dashboard). Here you’ll see a quick preview of many of the metrics that you would look at to see how your newsletter is performing: sent, opens, unique opens, open rate, total clicks, CTR, opt-out/unsubscribe rate, and spam reports.

Here you will also be able to see statistics by recipient list for that newsletter.
