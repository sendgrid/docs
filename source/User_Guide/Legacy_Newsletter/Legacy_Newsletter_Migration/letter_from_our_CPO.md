{% endanchor %}

We will retire Legacy Newsletter on September 30, 2017. This will allow us to better serve your email marketing needs by focusing on supporting and enhancing Marketing Campaigns, the future of email marketing at SendGrid.

We understand this may impact your business, and want to make the transition as simple as we can. We’re also confident that once you move to Marketing Campaigns, you’ll see even more value out of your email marketing efforts.

To get started, [take a minute to learn]({{root_url}}/User_Guide/Legacy_Newsletter/Legacy_Newsletter_Migration/index.html) about how Marketing Campaigns and Legacy Newsletter differ—and how you can make the switch today. You’ll find:

* [FAQs]({{root_url}}/User_Guide/Legacy_Newsletter/Legacy_Newsletter_Migration/faq.html) Legacy Newsletter users have about Marketing Campaigns
* A side-by-side [feature comparison]({{root_url}}/User_Guide/Legacy_Newsletter/Legacy_Newsletter_Migration/Side_by_Side_Comparisons/index.html) of Legacy Newsletter vs. Marketing Campaigns
* [Pricing info]({{root_url}}/User_Guide/Legacy_Newsletter/Legacy_Newsletter_Migration/Side_by_Side_Comparisons/pricing.html), and much more!

To make the transition even simpler, when you migrate to Marketing Campaigns you’ll have the option to continue paying $0.25/1,000 emails sent on the [Choose How You Pay]( https://app.sendgrid.com/settings/choose_how_you_pay) page in your account. Note: To be eligible for this pricing offer you need to have sent email via Legacy Newsletter between August 1, 2016 and March 30, 2017.

<strong>Remember, you can get started with Marketing Campaigns at no cost: your first 2,000 contacts are free.</strong>

Kind regards,

Steve Sloan<br />
Chief Product Officer
