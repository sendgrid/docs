If you want to send a SendGrid email when you add new Firebase child records, you can do that using [Zapier](http://zapier.com).

You will need:

* a [Firebase](http://www.firebase.com) account
* a [SendGrid](http://sendgrid.com) account
* a [Zapier](http://zapier.com) account

## Steps

1. [Getting your accounts ready](#ready)
2. [Connecting your accounts](#connect)

### Getting your accounts ready<a name="ready"></a>


To connect your Firebase account you will need an active Firebase account. To get started with Firebase, go [here](https://www.firebase.com/tutorial/). You can learn more about getting started with Firebase on Zapier, [here](https://zapier.com/help/firebase/#how-get-started-firebase).

To link your Firebase to SendGrid, you must have an active SendGrid account. To learn more about getting started with SendGrid basics, start [here](https://sendgrid.com/docs/index.html). For more information about getting started with SendGrid on Zapier, go [here](https://zapier.com/help/sendgrid/#how-get-started-sendgrid).

Click here to [Send SendGrid email when new Firebase child records are added](https://zapier.com/zapbook/zaps/3291/send-emails-with-sendgrid-when-new-firebase-child-records-are-added/).

1. Choose your Firebase account from the list of accounts, or connect a new account.
2. To connect a new Firebase account to your Zapier, you will need to enter the name of the **Firebase instance** you wish to use, and the **Secret** to authenticate the connection. You can find your secret authentication under the Auth tab.

7. Click **Save + Finish**.

Now test the Zap to make sure it works. Once you’re satisfied with the results, new child records created in Firebase will send corresponding emails in SendGrid.

*Note: if you ever want to change this Firebase and SendGrid integration, just go to [your Zapier dashboard](https://zapier.com/app/dashboard) and tweak anything you'd like.*
