To send email through SendGrid using WordPress we recommend the [Official SendGrid WordPress Plugin](http://wordpress.org/plugins/sendgrid-email-delivery-simplified/). To install, use the WordPress admin panel or follow [these instructions](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/sendgrid-email-delivery-simplified/installation/). Once installed, click on the Settings link for the plugin on your plugins page, enter your SendGrid username and password, and you'll be ready to go!
