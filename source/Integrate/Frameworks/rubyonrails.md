This example shows how to send an email for user signups. You can also checkout <a href='https://github.com/stephenb/sendgrid/'>this gem</a> for more advanced features.

{% anchor h2 %}
Setup ActionMailer
{% endanchor %}

Let's generate a Mailer class. Mailer classes function as our
controllers for email views.

{% codeblock lang:bash %}
$ rails generate mailer UserNotifier
{% endcodeblock %}

Now we open up the mailer we've just generated, <code>app/mailers/usernotifier.rb</code> and add a mailer action that sends users a signup email.

{% codeblock lang:ruby %}
class UserNotifier < ActionMailer::Base
  default :from => 'any_from_address@example.com'

  # send a signup email to the user, pass in the user object that   contains the user's email address
  def send_signup_email(user)
    @user = user
    mail( :to => @user.email,
    :subject => 'Thanks for signing up for our amazing app' )
  end
end
{% endcodeblock %}

Now we need a view that corresponds to our action and outputs HTML for our email. Create a file <code>app/views/Usernotifier/send_signup_email.erb</code> as follows:

{% codeblock lang:html %}
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <meta content='text/html; charset=UTF-8' http-equiv='Content-Type' />
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>Thanks for signing up, <%= @user.name %>!</h1>
    <p>Thanks for joining and have a great day! Now sign in and do
awesome things!</p>
  </body>
</html>
{% endcodeblock %}

If you don't have a user model quite yet, generate one quickly.

{% codeblock lang:bash %}
$ rails generate scaffold user name email login
$ rake db:migrate
{% endcodeblock %}

Now in the controller for the user model <code>app/controllers/users_controller.rb</code>, add a call to UserNotifier.send_signup_email when a user is saved.

{% codeblock lang:ruby %}
class UsersController < ApplicationController
  def create
    # Create the user from params
    @user = User.new(params[:user])
    if @user.save
      # Deliver the signup email
      UserNotifier.send_signup_email(@user).deliver
      redirect_to(@user, :notice => 'User created')
    else
      render :action => 'new'
    end
  end
end
{% endcodeblock %}

Alright, now we're cooking! Let's get it all going through SendGrid.

{% anchor h2 %}
Configure ActionMailer to Use SendGrid
{% endanchor %}

In <code>config/environment.rb</code> specify your ActionMailer settings to point to SendGrid's servers.

{% codeblock lang:ruby %}
ActionMailer::Base.smtp_settings = {
  :user_name => 'your_sendgrid_username',
  :password => 'your_sendgrid_password',
  :domain => 'yourdomain.com',
  :address => 'smtp.sendgrid.net',
  :port => 587,
  :authentication => :plain,
  :enable_starttls_auto => true
}
{% endcodeblock %}

That's it! When a new user object is saved, an email will be sent to
the user via SendGrid.

{% warning %}
As a best practice, you should not store your credentials directly in
the source but should instead store them in configuration files or
environment variables. See this tutorial on <a
  href='http://railsapps.github.io/rails-environment-variables.html'>environment
  variables in Rails</a>.
