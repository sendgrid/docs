Undelivered email can be the result of several things but most commonly there is an issue with the email address or content.
Once an email send has been attempted, but failed, a couple things can happen to your email:

* Bounced emails are ones that were rejected by the recipient's server
* Invalid emails were sent to email addresses that do not exist
* Emails can be marked as <a href="{{root_url}}/glossary/spam.html">spam</a> by the recipient for various reasons
* An email is <a href="{{root_url}}/glossary/drops.html">Dropped</a> when the recipient is on a <a href="{{root_url}}/help-support/analytics-and-reporting/index-suppressions.html">suppression list</a>
