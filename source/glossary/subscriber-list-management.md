Maintaining good list management is a key element in keeping your users happy. Sending email to someone who has unsubscribed or never signed up in the 1st place is a big no-no in the email game.

Make sure to check your list stats. You can do this in [Marketing Campaigns]({{root_url}}/User_Guide/Marketing_Campaigns/index.html) by clicking on the stats button next to your recipient list name. You can also [manage your unsubscribes]({{root_url}}/User_Guide/Suppressions/index.html) by clicking the manage unsubscribes button next to your recipient list name.

Make sure you are sending mail to people who actually want your mail. Otherwise, you will get lots of [spam reports]({{root_url}}/Glossary/spam_reports.html), [blocks]({{root_url}}/Glossary/blocks.html) and [bounces]({{root_url}}/Glossary/bounces.html).

Finally, make sure you do not buy email lists or engaging in [Email Harvesting]({{root_url}}/Glossary/email_harvesting.html). For tips on getting your messages to the Inbox, please see our [email deliverability]({{root_url}}/Classroom/Deliver/index.html) page.
