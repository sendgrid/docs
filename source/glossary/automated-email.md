Automated email, also known as [triggered email]({{root_url}}/glossary/triggered-email.html) or behavior-driven email, is sent when a specific [triggering event]({{root_url}}/glossary/triggering-events.html) occurs or a specific user takes an action that prompts the delivery of the email. While traditional marketing email involves sender-initiated promotional messages sent to a list of recipients, automated email is initiated by user behavior, allowing you to dynamically send targeted, real-time promotional content that is uniquely relevant to an individual recipient.

Examples of email automation include a welcome series [drip campaign]({{root_url}}/glossary/drip-campaign.html) that is initiated by a new user sign-up or a win-back campaign to re-engage a lapsed user.

The ability to send very relevant, timely emails directed to individual recipients makes automated email a uniquely powerful tool for building and nurturing customer relationships, enhancing the image of your brand, and increasing customer engagement.
