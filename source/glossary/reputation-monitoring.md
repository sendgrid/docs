You will notice on your [Account Overview]({{site.app_url}}) page you will see your IP reputation score, which will be somewhere from 0% to 100%. This score will go up or down based on your [bounce]({{root_url}}/glossary/bounces.html), [block]({{root_url}}/glossary/blocks.html), [spam]({{root_url}}/glossary/spam-reports.html) and invalid rates.
