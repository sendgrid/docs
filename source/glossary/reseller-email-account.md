Having a Reseller Email account means SendGrid has a formal reseller partnership with a company and all billing and usage is integrated into SendGrid. This usually means a platform is reselling SendGridâ€™s product under their own platform. 

SendGrid makes it easy to manage your customers via our [Reseller API]({{root_url}}/API_Reference/Web_API/Reseller_API/index.html).
