<p>The Marketing Email Dashboard lets you view information regarding your sent and pending marketing emails. On the dashboard you can see:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Chart with statistics for the last sent marketing email</li>
	<li>Chart with statistics for all of your marketing emails</li>
	<li>Chart with recipient list progressions over time</li>
	<li>Recent marketing email drafts with the option to resume composition</li>
	<li>Quick links to all major modules</li>
	<li>Latest entries from live Blog and Twitter account</li>
</ul>

<p>On the dashboard page there are three charts: One for recipient list progressions over time, one for the statistics of the last sent marketing email and another one for the overall statistics of your marketing emails.</p>

<p>The dashboard page's default display is a chart of the last sent marketing email's statistics. Above that chart we have two tabs which give us the possibility to select between a view of "Global Marketing Email Stats" and "Latest Marketing Email Stats". When clicking the "Global Marketing Email Stats" tab, a chart for the overall statistics will be displayed. When clicking "Latest Marketing Email Stats", the statistics for the last sent marketing email will appear.</p>

<p>Under these charts we have a legend containing two links: one that allows us to "Display by percentage" and another one that gives us the possibility to display the actual figures for our marketing email statistics.</p>

<p> There are also many different email stats available to you throughout SendGrid's Marketing Email application. Below are a list of stats and clarification of what they mean: </p>

<li>Requests = Requests</li>
<li>Delivered = Delivered/Requests</li>
<li>Opens = Total Opens/Delivered (Open Rate) </li>
